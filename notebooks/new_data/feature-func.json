I tried uninstall and reinstall, and its the same. It was ok before the last update.","1":"App runs too slow!!!","2":"This is a great app. I've used ODB on my iPod Touch and then my iPhone before I got an iPad 2. Each version is more refined. I like the way that the app remembers my choice of Bible version (currently 'The Message') when I tap on the Scripture for the day. This isn't the case with the iPhone app. One always has to change the version from the default.\n\nThere are a couple formatting issue suggestions:\n\n1. The poem at the bottom of the page is almost never formatted like the online website. It would be nice if the lines were stacked and not simply strung out in a row.\n2. One of the things I've always enjoyed are the cover photos. The cover for the current month shows in the upper righthand corner, but there is no way to enlarge it. One would think that a simple double-tap could bring up the cover art full screen?\n3. When traveling I don't always have a wifi link, so having issues cached is nice. In those instances I simply use my Bible app (or print version) to get the Scripture for the day. I don't expect (or want) ODB to cache the Scripture from Biblegateway.com on my device, but it would be nice if there was a way in the app set-up to direct the ODB app to my Olivetree app onboard for the Scripture of the day. May be too difficult for what is already an elegant app.\n\nKeep up the good work!","3":"I listen to it a lot. However, it will once in a while disconnect for no apparent reason. When it disconnects, it will repeat previous transmissions. I would like more APD and less Fire and Ambulance. Great app!","4":"Easy to use. I wished it was able to determine what hole you were on.","5":"I would of given it a 5 if I could pin on Pinterest from it.","6":"Developers nd attention here.\tAftr processing the quality of the picture gts dampened or turns bad... need to fix ths all","7":"I just wish it would notify me if I go below a certain dollar amount","8":"Keeps auto-deleting every 3 days\tThis app is quite nice but ever since the last update it keeps auto deleting. I have re-installed it thrice including today. That is just wrong!","9":"This is a very useful and helpful app In my opinion, the only thing it's missing is video handling You can add pictures and audio to your notes, and I think you should be able to add videos, too","10":"Wont load\tI have been playin this for few weeks now all of sudden it wont load","11":"Slow.Buggy\tIt takes more than a minute to open a file which is opened within 10 seconds in polaris office-Tab 2-3100. Needs speed improvement. Edit: It shows only a blank white screen when we try to open some .doc files!!OMG Developers! I hope you have tested the file which I have sent to you.","12":"Crashes since update\tCrashes whenever I go to the purchase coins section. Purchased coins but they dont show...","13":"Dropbox is a great service However, when I use the camera upload option in iOS 7, it only uploads the original photo and not the edited one Otherwise, I'd rate dropbox as 5 stars","14":"I have Day One on both my iOS devices, and my Mac. It just works beautifully, seamlessly, and smoothly.\n\nAdd simple photo function, and you'll rule the journal app world. \n\nFive star!","15":"Seems fun\tThis seems like a fun game but keeps crashing whenever it goes to a new screen. I think it takes to much ram.","16":"Love this game. But since the update it crashes every time I sink my first battle since update. I'm on the galaxy note 2. Please fix and I'll go back to 5 stars","17":"Problems\tI signed out and tried to sign back in later and it says i have no pages to manage.","18":"Can we get push notifications for other things being shared, besides just folders My bf is a photographer, he often sticks photos in our shared folder - would like a notification when things arrive (I do have them turned on but never get them)","19":"This app is awesome and makes recording everything so easy, the only thing I can request is to make it compatible with iPads!","20":"I also like WW Kitchen and often add my own recipes. It would be great if the two apps were integrated so if I added a recipe in WW Kitchen, I could pull it up in WW Mobile.","21":"If we could create docs inside the app that would be great","22":"Not good now game\tGame freezes don't know why please help can't get out of game","23":"It's super easy to copy pictures to clipboard or even save them to your phone, but why can't I download my videos?","24":"Sucks\tForces close when trying to post on instagram","25":"Nice update but still crash sometimes\tNew updates now just fine...but still crashes sometime while playing especially at chapter 5 while fighting man o war on storm weather...force quit to home screen~ hope for the fixes","26":"No sound.\tGoogle Nexus 7 2013  This is a 5 star game, otherwise. Fix the sound so I can change my rating.","27":"Great app for news on demand. No wasted screens to navigate through. Would give it 5th star if there was a button to close the app. Love NPR!","28":"Native crash when selecting the new ship\tUpdate: they fixed the 0 of 0 issue, but app got native crash when selecting the new ship... Pros: nice graphics, beautiful ocean simulation. Cons: no immersive mode for 4.4 devices, the game is a bit short and game mode\/event is too simple, the battle gets a bit boring after a few hours.","29":"Ruined by DRM\tI tried to play it, but all I get is, 'Can't Access License Server\" - really?  DRM is destroying games on my mobile devices too??","30":"I love these quotes. Only wish the quotes could appear in my notifications area. I'd pay for a full version!","31":"Great information is available  Wish maps (locations of newer hotels were updated more)  Also would love to have an individual resort map of all the resorts available to view  Would be great if age of property and renovation dates were included for hotels, too","32":"Black screen on nexus 7\tWhen the race starts the screen goes black. Can't see car or the track. Please help.","33":"Game keeps crahing on me please fix.","34":"Cool tool. Works fast. Smooth. Boring backgrounds. And it would be mice to be able to it the compass rose for a better look. But all in all very nice app. Thanks.","35":"Sony xperia sp\tSony xperia sp native resolution not supported","36":"It would be good if....\tIt eould be good if the focus wasn't screwed up. Works fine on all the other camera apps except this one.  Focus set as macro acts like its set on auto, set as auto it acts as macro. And forGET it if its on night shot.","37":"After the update, this game crashes after any battle.\tPlease fix the problem!","38":"Best gr8\tLike it nice good job plz add more frame for free pack","39":"Needs ART support\tGame was just updated today and still doesn't support ART runtime. Opens to main screen then force closes. Works fine on dalvik, but it is the only app I have that doesn't work on ART.  Once this problem has been addressed will update review and rating.","40":"Simple enough to use and I love the recurring transactions. No more forgetting and figuring out how to balance my checkbook every month. The other reason I got the app is because it can export to Quickbooks although I have not used that feature yet. The reports are great. Would love to be able to have main categories and sub-categories. That's the only thing missing in my opinion to make this a truly robust stand-alone financial management app. Keep up the good work!","41":"The app drains your battery cause it uses your gps all the time","42":"Takes the translation rather literally. Most languages other than English don't say \"what's your name\". If they could add a common phrase translator function then it would be just that much more accurate","43":"I have already submitted a review when I first downloaded stating That this App is the best. Well, yesterday it proved itself. I have a health condition and yesterday I had to go to the hospital. I just emailed myself my list, printed it and was able to give it to doctor. Even the Nurses and Doctors were impressed. \n\nThere is one thing, however, that I think would make this App even better. Add a COMMENT Area so you can write comments regarding yourself or the medications or whatever.","44":"Worked great at first...\tWorked great with the scheduling feature for a while... Now it says for me to check my connection and that an unexpected error occurred. I tried it on both wifi and 4g. I also tried restarting the phone and uninstalling and reinstalling the program. No help. I have a ZTE Avid.","45":"Its amazing The only thing to make it better is to have the ability or export videos to your camara roll","46":"Annoyed\tI would like to log in one time and it stays logged on. Also my camera would not work on here but it works fine with my other apps.... need to fix asap.","47":"Very slow uploading, and poor background uploading ( does it really need 3h to upload several megabyte video over 10 Mbit internet ?","48":"Overall fantastic.\n\nThe UI is a little clunky, and things like tapping in the golf ball icon to measure club distance were a little tough to find. It doesn't look like a button.\n\nWish I could view the clubs and look at their performance without starting a round.\n\nStatistics could use some work as well. The charts while fairly easy to read seem disjointed. \n\nNeeds a better social aspect.","49":"Good when it works, but annoying when it plays up\tGetting fed up of having to uninstall because it doesn't allow you to work on a new picture....","50":"Widget problem\tThere are problem in widget after some days widget gone and not show in Widgets bar\r","51":"Hope it had whatsApp to sms though! ","52":"Can't read exel file correctly\tAfter updated yesterday. I can't read the exel file correct as original.

Trying to automate it would be good if it worked, but it doesn't","55":"Video call camera\tPlease fix camera for video call on Galaxy Tab 2 7\", receiver see me upside down..","56":"I use this app for completing my required expense report. Stores pics so you can return to them, pics are super clear. I'd only wish for a two per page option as the scans come back a full page. Overall, only $2. Hell of an app.","57":"Please fix this\tI still cant download it..","58":"Poor !\tWhy it doesn't work? I've captured my face then it shown processing but nothing happens and keep returning me to the camera. Please fix it . I'm using galaxy tab 7.0 plus","59":"Do you when you go to the sampler and you try to record a song. And then you make a mistake in the song and doesn't sound as good. Can you try to make that update?","60":"Great app. Just need a more accessible speaker button.","61":"New Update Is Rubbish\tIts now really laggy and slow when going into the filters,  for manual focus, for turning the flash on and off, I much preferred the old interface - samsung galaxy s3 mini\r","62":"So slow loading at first\tBuggy new update","63":"less then 1 star\tDownloaded and not been able to play yet as keeps crashing and closing","64":"They should add the function to buy Starbucks gift cards via iTunes store. I wonder if they'll add that when iOS6 comes in with passbook?","65":"zzzz\tkeeps closing\/crashing losing all my work zzzz FIX IT!","66":"Not working.\tI have a wifi printer and when I try to print from my droid RAZR Max HD it says need to download update.. then when I try to download update, it says Update cannont be completed. Error. Fix and I'll change my rating. Or advise me what to do.\r","67":"Great app, only one suggestion, it would be great if it allowed for daily flow values.","68":"Great app! Works great with my playlists! Wish it worked with Pandora! Definitely not worth paying for the pay version of C25k because this up to date.","69":"Would be nice to have a grid view of photos other than just the auto upload of camera roll Also would be nice to rename files\n\nMy last review still not fixed This app doesn't support mobi file uploads Would be nice to save my mobi files","70":"Buggy app broke by update\tAnother paid app fail.  Edit: back to 1 star again! Now crashes everytime a battles won.","71":"hanging the phone\tit is hanging the phone so that I must 2 restart>","72":"Glitchy\tWould never load my new emails. Switched back to native email client on my Note II.","73":"We should be able to do text documents! (","74":"When I put things into my dropbox folder on my desktop, I can find files by date modified, by name, etc  The app has an incomprehensible and un-modifyable sorting function  It's almost impossible to find files within the app  Once you find them on your phone, I believe you can 'favorite' them  But the challenge is to find them","75":"I hoped the update would bring back the 'open in' option but it didn't Importing files into other apps is a major pain now Why was this option removed? Please bring it back","76":"Didn't work\tIve been trying to download this game for a week and it will not load at all disappointed because it looks like a great game","77":"It's ok\tI'd give it a higher rating,  but I have a small problem. My problem is that I've tried to more than once import my bookmarks from Android and it keeps crashing. Please fix. Thanks.","78":"Please include the option to view thumbnail larger while viewing in the photo folder","79":"Wonderful but\tCould be better if all tools built-in and not depending upon the network connection","80":"awesome\tbt plz increase the size videos that we send","81":"It just needs to play the next song after one ends and it will definetely get the 5 stars","82":"Great app - beautiful layout But I wish saved items could be viewed offline!","83":"I love iTunes U! Would be awesome to archive courses so they don't show on the bookshelf but can be accessed later.","84":"This would easily be a 5 star app Best idea ever  But it loses 2 stars just because I have to download one photo at a time This is a huge inconvenience","85":"Pay version still spamming\tI bought the paid version and I can still see promotions in the dashboard.  Remove it!  Edit: Developers asked me to disable promotions.  I did so, there seems to be an option to autocheck new promotions .  However,  this only disables the updating. The annoying ad-bar is still visible on the dashboard displaying a generic promotion of their products.","86":"Bugged\tThe last update caused the game to stop working. It won't even start now. Please fix.  New update still didn't fix anything. :\/","87":"Doesn't work\tA poor app unfortunately. It started loading pictures then took me back to homescreen with no video or upload.","88":"Beautiful app, but NEEDS the ability share folders For people on the go, we need to be able to email links out to people, sending tons of individual links to people is not feasible","89":"Bug\tThe gold mystery sprout does not work. Should be a 100% chance to give me a plant that I don't have. Just getting kinds that I have already.","90":"Could be better\tApp freezes time to time and laggy.","91":"Shocking\tPlayed this on a iPad and it was quality. Download it on my Xperia z tablet and the game is upside down. It is impossible to play and gone past the refund stage, no worth risking losing 2.99 in my opinion","92":"Great app! Couple suggestions for the next update though. Add a way to see the degree of angles and also it would be great to actually be able to have two videos side by side to compare.","93":"Server error\tIn Belgium I bought on PlayStore and says need extra 160 MB to download, but always get server error 5002.  Thanks for taking my money!","94":"Great App!! Useful and easy to use!","95":"This is the best video editor ever!!! I also like extras for iMovie but the only thing was that I wished I could cut out things people said that I didn't want. Other than that I love it!!!","96":"I've been using Dropbox for quite sometime now, I have earned a fair amount of space, and I love being able to access all my files from my iPhone, iPad, MacBook, and the Internet via anyone else's computer\n\nBut these last 2 updates have disabled the save to camera roll feature, which I use all the time and have come across several times since the new update Please please please add this feature back! I know I can just do a screen shot but i prefer the clean cut copy you receive, without boarders from saving images to the camera roll!","97":"Love the app. It's accurate and useful. I hope you guys planed for push notification soon.","98":"I actually believe this app is totally awesome in helping me prepare for my boards. However, just as the muscle name is given in audio; I wish there was an option hearing all the muscles info in audio. For me, retaining info comes better in audio, activities, and constant quizzing.","99":"Note 3 online not working\tCouple of weeks ago im able to play in online and now it says cant connect check ur network, but i have highspeed internet","100":"Couldn't be better really, with options to copy results and also send via text\/email..  would like to see an option for viewing results full-screen, sometimes the end gets cut off.. but it still copies\/pastes all of it so it's cool ;)","101":"Camera DOOM FX\tPictures will not save to external SD card.

Also, would like to have the ability to preload certain maps. Takes too long sometimes to load maps over cell signal. Preloaded maps would eliminate that problem.","118":"Well, I am not experiencing the issues with slowness that others have complained about. For me, it loads at an acceptable speed.  It definitely beats the hell out of foodnetwork.com's haphazard, cumbersome list. \n\nI do agree that it could benefit from the addition of reviews. It would also be awesome to be able to see a segment of the show featuring each eatery, though I suspect that would require Food Network to be much more involved.","119":"Good but\tWas running perfectly before the update,task killer no working Displays no tasks","120":"It is impossible to refine a hotel search for specific criteria beyond location, price and quality Those are well done and quality reviews and coverage are the reasons we use TA Especially during peak seasonal flows, many of us travel with pets We have a terrible time finding clean, reliable hotels Most sites for pet travel are woefully inadequate How hard would it be to include this as an additional search filter? That would bring in helpful reviews that would not only enhance the site experience but also improve the field","121":"Probably a great app for 4 and up. I've used it with several 2 year olds and it's amazing how quickly they catch onto the spelling part. However they are confused by the plane when they can't move it. The tilting the iPad this is not natural for them and the fact that if you're not directly on the plane when you try to trace the letters really throws them off.. If only there was a way to play this on easy mode it would be perfect for younger kids to learn their ABCs. Then activate the tilt functions when they are older or master the easy parts.","122":"One thing needed\tYou should be able to have sub-boards  For example You would have the board Food Then on the board food you could have a sub board for dessert Or healthy Our brunch","123":"Does everything you would hope it would do well \r\n\r\nI wish I could email documents from Dropbox as attachments not as links","124":"Wth\tWorked fine u see the video with the music once u put it on instagram it cuts it at the end or it just turned all black","125":"bugs bugs bugs\tlots of bug i cannot login anymore...my device lag when trying to open the app...fix this sucks!!!","126":"Would love to be able to print right from the app instead of having to go through the browser or open it in another app Otherwise very convenient","127":"Force closes all the time\tThis app isn't worth the money.

They're beyond amazing on my wife's iPhone 4! As a heavy user of Dragon Dictation, it would be very useful to be able to clear the screen and start new, perhaps by shaking the iPhone. Sometimes it's easier to start over rather than edit out one word.","152":"I'm giving the NFL '12 v3 update three stars largely because it's an improvement over the previous version. The in-game display is better organized, and the \"Scores\" page is vastly superior to the prior version: you can now see all games for the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list. After a modest amount of use, the app appears much more stable.\n\nHowever, it still needs work in many respects. The scoring summary is gone (so far as I can tell); I often found this helpful when checking up on games that I wasn't following play-by-play. The \"team leaders\" appears limited to only 1 QB (passing), 1 player rushing, and 2 receivers, with no apparent way to scroll through players or pull up a full listing. Especially during the preseason games, when teams are running through multiple personnel packages, this is very frustrating--there's no way (for example) to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs who have gotten playing time. A more egregious problem is that (at least for the Thursday games in week 2), the teams do not switch properly: checking on the Atlanta vs. Cincinnati game, if I tap on the \"Atlanta Falcons\" button, I get the passing stats for A. Dalton; if i tap on the \"Cincinnati\" button I see the passing stats for M. Ryan (with the rushing and receiving stats for their teams). I'm hoping this is an operator error that will be fixed shortly, but it reflects poorly on the product. (I apologize for the comments length, I'm hoping that the NFL is monitoring this feedback.)","153":"I just wish you could edit your word documents other than that it's great!","154":"The one good thing about the last update ws the ability to make folders. But, you are not able to make folders inside folders. I wish you could. The bad things about the last update? Now typing has lag which is very annoying. I don't see how that happened since there is no crazy graphical interface or anything animated. The major thing that is pretty much a deal breaker for most people is the removal of the TAB button. I always hated that the TAB button was up on the ruler. I would prefer having only one shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard. But now i wish it was back up top at least. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it. I've stopped using Pages now since it is such a pain to tab unless you are using a bluetooth keyboard.","155":"The inverted colors of the icon induce retinal after images, and in-app, the whiteout is hard on the eyes The experience on an iPad Air is one of huge expanses of white or badly contrasting off-whitelight blue and stencil-thin pale icons battling the brightness of it all The spartan look works fine on an iPhone, where there is proportionately less white assaulting the eye with the iPad, however, I keep trying to reduce the brightness of the display, but that only further impacts contrast and legibility \r\nAlso why is it not possible to change names of files or folders??","156":"Help\tWon't let me download its saying I have no memory on my phone but I do I have loads :\/","157":"It would pull the contacts I have on facebook, but not on my phone, and put them on my phone.","158":"Wont create team\tThe game is good but when I try to create the team all I get is a go back button.","159":"update kept crashing\tWhat was a barely usable programme to begin with, kept crashing after I updated. So I have now Uninstalled it.","160":"Not very impressive\tI am a graduate student and I use my tablet a lot for taking notes during presentation and to read papers. I am disappointed as I can't use the software to present ppt. Also, the draw free form option is not very user friendly as it doesn't allow to draw in different colors nor to erase.","161":"Would totally give 5 stars if u didn't have to use the app by itself & send from there!

That's a DOWNGRADE.","175":"Great!\tOnly complaint is being able to change the picture that represents your boards And just a user friendlier way to change settings and customizeadd pictures to your boards","176":"I sat down and worked out the equiv. IQ for each category based on the data given and Average professional college IQ used for this program 119.985 ~120.\n\nIt would be really nice to get an integrated IQ-Equiv feature that showed us this information like the excel calculator I made for myself.\n\nKeep up the great work!","177":"Now that I have this app I can't imagine how I got anywhere without it. In my experience it's approx 98% accurate and the spoken directions are a necessity when you're driving alone. One improvement would be to have the spoken directions a little earlier especially on a busy highway. I'd recommend this app to anyone looking for reliable accurate directions.","178":"I love pasting notes to ever note I paste my passwords I paste copies of receipts and anything that I need to locate later and I can easily find it in one location the search option is very handy as well I WISH THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE CLEARER","179":"Still landscape only  So weird  Every other app has the ability to go either direction  Too bad","180":"So so\tWhy cant email be marked as unread? Why when I reply to an email it turns up in my inbox?","181":"The recent update makes this app look really beautiful (upgrade from the previous version!) but in the process we have lost functionality and it is not intuitive. I am a woman and the arrows are kinda small to navigate between areas; I could only imagine how most men--the likely demographic--feel about this app. Additionally, It takes too long to move between the screens. I want to easily\/quickly set my line up, maybe see my opponent's, get quick updates on the health or status of my players for the week, and see the weekly fantasy scores as they update.","182":"Broken Multiplayer\tMultiplayer doesn't work at all, I just get failed to connect every time. Would give 5 stars if online ever gets fixed.","183":"Useful, improved\tHappy with the progress on this app but there are many updates that seem to make no change Can't see the names of many boards - there needs to be a wrapped text function on board names so long board names can be seen Indexing is very slow too, many of my pins take weeks to come up in search","184":"Why doesn't the music work\tUpsetting to have a clip made but NO music... Tried it for my business and this Is actually very disappointing.","185":"This is probably the app I am the most thankful for on my iPhone -- perhaps second to Omnifocus. Thanks to this app and the care given it by its development team, my wife and I are finally budget -- not account. The account balance is servant to the budget and how we have planned to spend our income. \n\nIf you are moving from something like Quicken, then there is a bit of a learning curve. The YNAB website is there with excellent video tutorials to help you work through questions and situations. Awesome resource. \n\nLooking forward to iCloud sync and the possibilities it presents. Again, great app.","186":"Overall a great app.  I use it daily. It would be helpful if entrance and communion antiphons were included. I do not appreciate the new  in app purchase feature.  The saint of the day should either be included with the program or have a way to remove the buy button for those who do not want to purchase this.","187":"Not working properly .wont download emails to inbox","188":"Fix it please!\tThis new update detected as malware :(","189":"Galax s4\tCan't search for friends online","190":"I've been addicted forever,\tThe only thing I would change is that over time, I want it more organized so I make another board I wish there was a 'move pin' button to place it to another board current technique is having to repin, then delete it from the old board","191":"Very good.\tNeed to update voice ...sometime back ground noise comes Thanks","192":"Still no gallery in Camera Upload mode !","193":"Please support French and Mandarin. \nIn the interactive map, when click a country, pronounce the name of the country.","194":"Can't read text boxes well\tDecent, but can't seem to read documents with text boxes and images very well...","195":"Great game, sound not working though\tSound stopped working mid game and now it won't start!

Something to probably address is the photo not always saving what you're looking at in the preview. The beautify tool is a good example of this, as it may look fine in preview, but when you save it, you don't exactly get the same quality. Sometimes it turns out a little pixalated, but overall a remarkable app! I use this in conjunction with other apps.\r","204":"Multiplayer cant join\tCant join games, just keeps searching. I tried custom join and says error can't join","205":"The fact that you can search within folders is extremely useful, and makes accessing files on the go far more convenient I also think the latest style refresh is a big positive in the right direction I use dropbox on all of my devices I would like to see sorting within the app improved (eg by date), but it's good otherwise","206":"Thanks, Evernote, for a great app!  I use it DAILY to keep my (gluten-free, dairy-free) recipes organized!\r\n\r\nA tip Please allow me to search ALL my notebooks - helpful to locate an ingredient - rather than searching within each notebook individually\r\n\r\nAlso, I would love to pay a flat fee to be able to access my notes offline  Thanks","207":"Can't get a response from Developers\tThe game itself isn't bad. If anything,  a bit monotonous.  However,  the manual is less than desirable,  specifically when speaking about how to feed cows. I figured out meadows on my own, but cant make straw bales for the life of me. And, this is apparently hkw to create manure flr fertilizer. I have emailed the developers, amd received no response.

The messaging only works sometimes, no indication of it has been read or not.  It is a bandwidth hog. Corporations hate it on their networks. Oh and I still have out installed. Part of the herd....  :(","230":"Loved it until...\tThe most recent update has left me less than pleased.

During operation varying function such as aperture control, white balance, etc would cease to react irreproducably.

Sixsomes! THE BEST APP FOR GOLF!\n\n17 rounds under my belt with this app now and still very happy. The new in-app stats (v.1.3) blew me away!  Still waiting for side games (skins, etc.). I'm confused why so many golfers leave their phone on the entire round? I pull mine out as I'm walking up to my ball, usually while I'm 20-30 yards away, I get positive satellite lock by the time I'm standing over the ball, read my yardage and put the phone back to sleep. After putting I whip it out, score the entire foursome (takes about 15 seconds total) and then put it back to sleep. I consistently have 80-85% battery life after my round is complete.\n\nOnce we get side games\/betting included in a future update I will be even more of a cheerleader for this app!   \n\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nUsed Golfshot for my last 6 rounds and I will continue to use it forever! It's accurate, easy to use, and being able to email your scorecard to your buddies and review actual stats for yourself are perks I didn't know I wanted, but now I can't live without!\n\nEnded up being cheaper to buy a new iPhone 3GS AND this app than the skycaddie I was looking at. Stand alone golf GPS units are in serious trouble.","250":"good app, but to make it a great app, video would be a great feature. A must need is to make the timer continuous. After the 5 sec. countdown it would be great for it to restart automatically for continuous self shots. Please add that.","251":"I've had this app for about a year. I love it but can you bring back backups or dropbox so I can transfer files to my laptop. Please do this","252":"It needs more of the things that powerpoint has. It needs to be able to have music durring the presentation and more animations.","253":"Love it, just wish it had the option do make brochures,","254":"Great idea for an app and works okay for gas and chain restaurants, but that is literally all you will find. No grocery stores, cafes, or anything that is not fast food or large chains. No coffee shops other than Starbucks and no foreign foods, and definitely nothing remotely healthy. Also lacking an option for submissions.I was excited at the possibilities for this app but the reality is much more disappointing.","255":"99cents can't go wrong. I'd like to have a map feature, but overall it does what it was programmed to do well.","256":"But wish it had better ability to copy WODs if you do it more than once.\n\nUpdate: this app has come a long way and is really awesome now!! Love it!!","257":"I've been using Marine Traffic for years online and on my iPhone. Downloaded the iPad app and it's as simple (good thing) as always and the content is great.

It is the way apps should be. So simple and easy. I'm giving it 5 stars despite some shortcomings:\n\n1. It would be nice to sync with the desktop (iCal?) and between devices.\n2. It needs Reminders and Alerts (and Due Dates, etc.)\n3. Some kind of support for longer notes. Right now, single-tapping an item lets you edit the item. Maybe double-tapping should let you open an item's \"detail page\" where you could enter the due date, add an alarm, or type a longer note. \n4. Also, sharing a list? It would be great if my wife and I could add to or just see each other's shopping lists.

Why can't I publish reviews with app, why don't we earn open table points using app?","263":"It would be even better if you could drive an airplane.","264":"this is a pretty good app. great to be free. it is super slow on load time. that needs to be fixed. also change the default time. it's so annoying because sometimes I forget to change it and dont see all my hw. also push notofications would be wonderful! other than that it's great. I'm a sophomore math major taking 20 hours and this app helped me stay on top of things!","265":"It's need an update where u can post a new chapter of your story and where u can upload a cover for the story! >:0\nAnd it keeps crashing!","266":"NEEDS bulk upload and maybe some editing features. Photobucket's app is much better...what a shame. I would much rather use Shutterfly because of their awesome deals on print orders. But it takes way too long to upload from the iPhone. On the photobucket app as soon as you start the app it recognizes all the pics in your camera roll that haven't been previously uploaded and with one click it will upload all the new ones. Shutterfly needs this :-(","267":"They should add the photo editting option.Then this app would be perfect.","268":"It seems like it would be a great addition to have the hold mail feature from your website here also.  Please include this in the next release!","269":"It's almost 2011. Where is the multitasking?","270":"Requires access to grades and it'll get 5 strs in my book","271":"3 days won't do.

Now please give us multi account login, Google.","273":"I love the Brave version better than the original. The graphics are much better and I love the phrases she says.\n\nThe objective of hitting 100 is stupid when I don't know how I've done, if I have improved or not when a status on targets hit is not given. \n\nTally it up in a drop down much like the distance markers at the end of each target segment.","274":"Please make it more like the one on the computer like a option that you can download stuff","275":"? Why can't I sign into separate Drop Box accounts?","276":"You should put the folders first And then the files!\nI would put a folder as favorite, thus putting all the files inside this as favorite too","277":"Im on an original iPad mini and so maybe that's part of he deal but it seems like there are still little thins that need some work For example the spell check doesn't work just right and the search is slow at times Neither of these or any others will keep from giving this app a great rating \n\nI also think that here are improvements I hope to see in the future One is full screen mode Maybe I'm missing this but the only time you get full screen is when you start a new note I'd like this options when reading or editing too \n\nKeep up the good work!","278":"I have a premium account and I use Evernote for business and personal items all day long and I am very frustrated about the new advertisement section I've been graced with despite paying not to have advertisements  Also, there is no logic behind the new tag section I really like the the tag section, but I want to organize what pops up there I can't find a master list of reminders in the app or the desktop version Maybe I haven't looked hard enough, but this seems to be a gaping oversight  A calandra would be nifty as well","279":"Outstanding  Would be nice to have the PC app features available in IOS app","280":"The app present good features, but there is a lot of bugs and missing some hotkeys to make the writing easier","281":"This is really a great app an tool to manage multiple projects and scattered notes I just wish that there was a calendar integration and sub folders within stacks \n\nAlso in Evernote hello there is no categorizing \n\nBut make no mistake I swear by this program","282":"I would give this 5 stars if it had these two additional features\r\n\r\nAbility to use a scroll bar on iPad and iPhone rather than swipe, swipe, swipe and more swipe to get to the bottom of a note \r\n\r\nAbility to keyword search AND GO TO THAT KEYWORD like you can on the laptop version Having search feature for a word does me no good if I can't search within the note to find that word\r\n\r\nCan you do these two things for iOS please?","283":"This app has been very helpful on my honeymoon search It would be nice to be able to enlarge the photos though Other than that, it's perfect","284":"Please add landscape support for your fat-fingered users!","285":"No Galaxy Gear support\tPlease create an app for Galaxy Gear I can only read the notifications on my Gear I would love to have an option to reply directly from my Gear Thanks","286":"Perfect\tVry gud app for editingplz add some more interesting frame-)","287":"Love the service but annotations on PDFs have disappeared from Dropbox since iOS 7 update Need these back please","288":"Still no ability to change file names - a very basic function Hard to believe after this amount of time Error messages when simply trying to move files No response from dropbox","289":"I can't share folders!  That was the only reason I made a Dropbox in the first place  Ugh","290":"Even Google Drive can refresh folders \n\nSome simple suggestions to increase usability\n\n1 Currently, you have to leave the folder and come back in if you wish to refresh that folder Let me refresh my folder with a refresh button so that I can view changes to files in a more streamlined manner If I am constantly compiling a document on my computer and using my iPad to check that it looks okay or if I am constantly editing a photo and want a high quality, true color representation, then#REFRESH!\n2 Refresh Button\n3 Button that Refreshes the Current Folder's contents\n4 The air smells a bit Why don't we REFRESH it?\n5 It is stupidly simple to add a refresh button\n6 Mentos The Refresh Button Maker\n7 There's space on the top left of the app header to add a refresh button  Nothing is there at the moment It's lonely\n8 Give me an R, Give me an E, Give me an F, Give me an R, Give me an E, Give me an S, Give me an H! What does that spell? Easily implementable refresh button with high utility even to people who don't know they need it yet! Yaaay!","291":"Some places that had menus on the old version are missing them on the new one Other than that the app is extremely helpful and easy to use  Much improved navigation","292":"The new update loads slower, closes out on me when i press BACK from viewing photos, this update has glitches I don't like the search method and I wish you guys would make it easier to find RESORTS hotels similar to the ones you previously looked at like if I viewed a few months  ago a 5 star resort with a lazy river it show me similar resorts, I would like to stay at in another place (state,country)","293":"Can't get enough\tBrilliant app Switched to a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 after an iPhone and noticed the option to switch off timestamps is unavailable on Samsung devices If this could be included in the next update, 5 star rating sorted","294":"Video playback sucks\tThis is a wonderful app minus the videos To play one it takes you to an internet browser, then to youtube
