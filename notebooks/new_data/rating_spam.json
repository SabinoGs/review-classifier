I think not!!\tWhy in the world would I give anyone or application the right to make phone calls through my phone, edit my text messages and send them, take video and pictures?? This is sadly getting worse with each update and this is supposed to be a security program??? I was pleased at first with this app but have no respect for it or the idiots coming up with these updates. This needs to stop!!! Next you will need to access my credit report.

What comes basic in most quality editors, this app wants us to buy at up to $2 each totalling over $30.00!!!!?? what a rip off! It doesn't even have hue which I use more then any other filter. Highly dissatisfied! There are hundreds of editors in the play store plus most phones come with one that's fairly decent...  hit share to find yours.  Uninstalled.","47":"Blahh","48":"I lov\tMmmm","49":"Nice","50":"Nice\tCall you me","51":"Good\tSlowed","52":"10 year old package that barely works. Total waste of $15!\tDoesn't display many word documents and excel files.  Editing with that is a torture. I bought it because it was the best for Palm and blackberry. Wasted $15.. OfficeSuite 7 is the that does the job done.","53":"I want my money back\tThe one thing I hate about it always doesn't work it works when it wants to apps should be 99 cents instead of three dollars I don't think it's worth $3 I recommend you do not buy it unless you have money to waste!","54":"a\ta","55":"Good\tGood aps","56":"Costs too much and too many add ons\tDespite its many options, I've had experienced many issues with this product. It has crashed quite a few times already in the last two days, moreover why do I have to pay so much for 'add ons' that should be standard such as fonts and dictionary? This just shows the developer is being too greedy.  In addition it seems to be very slow on my nexus 10","57":"Abysmal controls and AI, repetitive campaign\tFun game, abysmal controls and AI.  Why on earth team 17 opted for touch controls instead of virtual arrows or a d-pad, I have no idea. Now the AI: uses grenades or bazooka about 90 percent of the time with absolute perfection. Calculating wind speeds and never missing a single shot even if it is necessary to shoot in the complete opposite direction and rely solely on wind. Please make it more human and make it use the other weapons a lot more often. Plus the campaign is just skirmish,  no actual missions.","58":"Nice\tI like it","59":"Awkward menus\tI bought this app. ..quickly attempted to do my most common types of formatting, and found it very slowly and fiddly on my note 2.  Much better on the BlackBerry.  So, as quickly as I could, I attempt to un install and get a refund, can't!!! So am I stuck?","60":"AVG\tTried and tried and tried to use the AVG find my phone part of this app. . Didn't find it once just kept saying try later.. so I did and kept on trying.. I paid for this app so I kind of expect it to work?? Not enough to the app either. . Dull to use.. looks Dull and had I not paid for it I would delete in a heart beat..\r","61":"Lacks features and options","62":"Good..\tNice....","63":"yo\tyo","64":"Bisso\tPp","65":"Not horrible...but\tAll in all, it's in the tradition of the franchise. In campaign mode it's pretty annoying that the AI never misses, and the wind is always exactly what it needs to hit.","66":"Ehhh\tEvery level after 19 is ridiculously hard.  The enemy worms take hardly any damage and seem to aim perfectly through the tiniest spaces while your worms die by 1st or 2nd turn,  leaving you with 1 worm against 8 or 9... I'm ready to uninstall","67":"Specs fail\tI noticed the same on my note 2 it says tht i have dual-core...\r","68":"Grt\tGud","69":"Android\tVery nice app","70":"Same old worms, terrible controls.\tThe developer has opted for the classic tap either side of the screen to move and drag the reticle to aim touch control system, it does not support controller or keyboard input. The result is a control system that is borderline unresponsive and makes fine movement or fast movement completely inefficient. This game is so tedious to play, it certainly isn't worth the hefty price tag associated with it. If you bought this during the sale; you got a great deal, but as someone who paid full price to support Team 17, I'm disappointed in this lackluster port. Overall the game is a great example of what can happen to a great idea when it's executed poorly. I am however, happy to give Team 17 a few extra dollars, and hope they make improvements over time.","71":"Money ripping\tI have played this game on pc and realised it was released for android platform. As soon as i downloaded it (and payed for it), it is ridiculous that they are still charging so much money for other mini games available in the game. Really disappointed with this. Please resolve this issue n i'll give this game a 5 star.","72":"See","73":"Ok","74":"Poor maintained product with great past but no future","75":"Good\tLike","76":"Lack there of ...","77":"Good app\tI really like the functionality and flexibility this app offers.","78":"Avg\tIts gud","79":"It's a handy app\tFor GMX users. Can be a lot more prettier, perhaps like gmail? Or is it too much to ask ;-)  Edited on 10\/8\/2013: extremely poor app. Too buggy. Shocking, especially coming from Germans. Have so much respect for German engineering!","80":"OK, not the best","81":"facebook","82":"Not played for long\tAs said cant say much played one part of the game and you ask for feadback so here it is","83":"Was good at first....\t..now every app comes up as false positive including Google Play!

Now complicated\r","86":"Pankaj\tNice...","87":"Good\tGood","88":"Old is Better","89":"There was a time for this app\tThe fact that the app needs me to register after I have paid for it sucks. The fact that it makes me do it with no way of turning it off other than hitting \"later\" every time it updates is a deal breaker. Get a 365 account and use Microsoft's full version of office.","90":"In need of an update\tYou guys have done nothing to improve what started out as a good thing. decent app with lazy devs.","91":"Yes\tYes","92":"Donzii\tI like PicsArt","93":"Nice but limited use\tLimited options stickers etc are available","94":"Goood\tGooooooood","95":"Nice\tVery  nice  dhis  apps","96":"i love it\tnice","97":"Its good\r","98":"Nice\tIts useful","99":"Good\tIts very good for android\r","100":"Good\tNice time killer","101":"Its the best.\tIts really cool.","102":"Mr.?\tAre u spying us?","103":"Not bad!\tFor a mobile game ya can't complain.","104":"Awesome\tThrilling","105":"1st level completed\tNot bad for the moment, just tryin' to get the controls as well, I will update this in few days :) Good job by now :)","106":"Good\tVery Good","107":"Average\tGood","108":"A great brain game but a little east\tEasy very easy","109":"Nice\tIts amazing","110":"Good","111":"Pretty app\tI just downloaded and i dot know what happen next :) hopely fine ok ;)","112":"Works\tOk.","113":"Keepas crashing\tAwesome game....when it works will freeze everytime I go into it ao I have to turn off my phone then turn it back on for it to work on my s4 galaxy.

That way CCITT compression could be used and the space saving would be dramatic. 90 percent of my scans would be fine in high rez 1 bit.   I've yet to see another app that can save to 1 bit (though they can be read by most PDF viewers), but given storage size concerns, I don't see why scan apps don't include this as an option.

I have 5 different sync folder pairs set up. One is for my pictures so that when I take a picture, it will instantly be sync'ed to my google cloud account, and then my PC syncs with google cloud, meaning I should never lose a picture.   I also do an occasional sync to my NAS drive as I'm a bit paranoid.  I also sync from my MP3 folder on my NAS account back onto my phone card, so that when I add some new music to my NAS drive, it will sync onto my phone.  Altogether a very useful program.","441":"Great security. Let's me know about any threats on my phone.","442":"Great app love it\tCan't get any better","443":"EA Keep up the good job!\tThe game's superb..","444":"I love. This. Game","445":"...\tBest app ever!\r","446":"Fun and engaging\tSo far the game has run smoothly, been enaging and fun. Its easy enough I don't get annoyed and hard enough I don't get bored. Will update after some time of playing.","447":"I likey\tVery useful because of my love of editing.","448":"Well\tAwesome","449":"Xperia Z1\tIt is an awesome product.  Most reliable.","450":"Cool\tCool","451":"I like this. . .\tThanks. . .","452":"Very good\tVery good","453":"A classic\tFinally a decent version of worms on Android.","454":"Like.\tAwesome","455":"Great app,  easy to use!\tThis app has completely surpassed my expectations! It is extremely easy to use, has a nice interface and let's you produce a wide variety of collages.","456":"This game is really fun and a great way to learn facts, geography, capitals, landmarks and locations of all of the great states in the United States! My nephews are into strategically placing the stacks. Super learning fun!","457":"I love how it tests my brain!","458":"You're probably thinking why pay when you can get something similar for free...I thought the same thing and finally ponied up (do you really spend *that* much more\/less on a cup of coffee?) and the value it's added on a daily basis is invaluable. Time tables are pretty accurate, but what I love are the service advisories that constantly change every weekend and the neighborhoods maps, not to mention the last minute emergencies on lines due to a water main break or police incident or what have you. Better to plan your trip to avoid a certain line rather than find out at the station when yellow tape is blocking your way, and you have to walk a half mile to catch another line and find out the same thing before saying SOD it and catching a cab. Has saved me so much in time.","459":"Easy to find songs and purchase in iTunes.","460":"Having fun. I never had much interest in astronomy, but this app has changed everything.","461":"Lots of fun to use... We live in a unpopulated area and it's neat to pick out which stars are what. The app works very well!","462":"It's really useful cuz I'm a astronomer          \n\nIt's magestical!:\/","463":"A very exciting app. I like to share with my kids.","464":"Very nice app","465":"Great info on Houston restaurants though some restaurant info needs to be updated such as those which have relocated.","466":"The only complaint I have about this app is that unless you live in one of the supported cities, it's pretty much useless. Even if you do live in a big city, the app won't help you at all if you're travelling somewhere smaller, which is why I recommend keeping a backup app like Urbanspoon on your iPhone as a backup.","467":"I bought this app on December 24th. I purchased mainly for hunting and the Google terrain map set. I had issued where the terrain map would not load, and was blacked out. All other maps and features worked fine. I emailed customer support that night around 11pm., and had a response and a solution via email when I checked mail at 9 am, Christmas morning! Now, that's what I would consider excellent support. Seems there was a small issue  with Google terrain maps that only affected purchases on Friday the 23rd, and Saturday the 24th. I am all fixed up now and everything works great!","468":"I use this app almost every weekend while exploring back roads and trails by motorcycle. Functionality is excellent while on the road as well as using the data to review later using Google Earth. \n\nI've tried all the GPS tracking apps and this is the one I go back to every time. \n\nI strongly recommend reading the users guide and watching the videos. 10 minutes spent learning the app will really pay off in how much use and function you get out of the app.","469":"I cannot believe how amazing the new changes are. If you mountain bike, hike, camp, or travel this is a must need app! It now tracks altitude, pace, speed, and about every other stat you need in any unit of measure. By far this is the best app I have!","470":"Pretty easy to use - been using it for over 2 years.  Easy to learn.  As new features were added, those features made sense!","471":"This is, hands down, the most useful app. I had the lite version but decided it was worth the money to upgrade. It makes it so much easier than the guess and check on the calendar. I love it!!","472":"Ran side by side with other and this app beat all hands down. Needs dedicated space for mileage.","473":"Love it's multifunctionality. Able to do multiple business and year prior expenses etc!","474":"This ap is great, really puts your collection at your fingertips! I really like how easy it is to manage your wine collection, buying, drinking or storage notes. Love it!","475":"Works awesome for me. Have 1200 cellar of mostly older bottles. Scan works a lot but type and search fills in. Really live off this app. love the drink now feature. Use that every week!","476":"Better than any other wine app.","477":"It is a good app but I eat a lot of home cooked meals and it's hard to find the exact thing I ate.","478":"This app is beast! The best thing is, is that it doesn't need Internet! Because I have an iPod touch so I don't have Internet on it in public. I recomend  this app!","479":"Buy it","480":"This is a great little app especially for those with hectic schedules it keeps you in like for visual people like me.","481":"Live sky does not work on my touch. Also, doesn't find my correct locAtion. So close to being like the Droid app...but off by a parsec.","482":"I keep tabs on my brother's flight info,  as he travels for work quite a bit. I'm a worrier by nature, so it's wonderful to be able to see the progress of his flights. I've always been able to pull them up easily & they've always been accurate. Great job!","483":"Used this app all over the world and it hasn't let me down yet!","484":"I take this on the mountain and on the bike trail. Continually improving in surprising ways. Keep up the great work!","485":"It's a pure joy already having a pic when your friends call and sometimes contacts info from your FB friends that you haven't taken the time out to acquire. Fabulous!","486":"I love the sync & bday reminders :)","487":"Works just fine.","488":"Great app!","489":"Now that it comes with iPad Keynote integration, this app is worthwhile to get.  My only complaint is that notifications on the iPad interrupt it.  Which you can fix Apple by improving the notification system.  *cough*.  So get this if you use Keynote :)","490":"To those concerned that you cannot zoom in on those savvy charts and reference materials included on this app...you CAN! Let me help. Simply tap on the chart or image itself. This will then immediately bring it up closer in its own page, and then you can get even closer by pinching. Just tap the images first, my friends. This is a great app.","491":"At first I didn't have the challenges on and literally got board in about 10min. But when I turn the challenges on I was all over it like a hawk of a dead animal. So to get to the point BETER THAN MODERN COMBAT 3!!!!!!","492":"BEST GAME EVER!!!!","493":"I can't find how to buy add ons. Plz help other wise great game","494":"I will give it 5 stars when you add girl pygmies.","495":"Great app to have for tracking flights! I own a limousine company & all my drivers use it to track their clients flights.","496":"Easy to use and very accurate. A must for any traveler!","497":"I just finished up a weekend of playing and it was the first time I have used this product. I was more than impressed with it! The setlist option was my favorite part. We played several different times throughout the weekend and being able to program the songs into setlist form made it super easy to transition between songs. I highly recommend this product and can't wait to use it again!","498":"A must buy.","499":"For the price, it's great. I've been using quicken for 5 years now, but I've switched to this app 2 years ago. My wife and I use the sync option and are now keeping a budge very easily. Awesome app- needs a desktop version!","500":"This app is a fixture in my college studies. Good Reader technology turbo charges my research and puts me ahead of the pack. I couple it with Instapaper, papers, and an air printer app or two and the power is in my hands (and pocket).","501":"I use this app every day on my iPhone 4 and it works perfectly fine.","502":"I enjoy sending verses to my friends on my iPhone","503":"I love having a new verse pop up every morning. Great for on the go, and if you're looking for a verse pertaining to a certain category whether it be encouragement, patience, etc. Very convenient. And beautiful background pictures.","504":"I love the convenience I having daily readings right at my fingertips, and when I travel to Europe for the semester, I don't know if I could live without it!","505":"Great for daily readings. I love it.","506":"This is an excellent app to use in the daily devotional reading of the mass readings.  Well done!","507":"Overall a great app.  I use it daily. It would be helpful if entrance and communion antiphons were included. I do not appreciate the new  in app purchase feature.  The saint of the day should either be included with the program or have a way to remove the buy button for those who do not want to purchase this.","508":"What a bargain for all the benefits I receive daily from this app!!  The audio is especially good to have.  Reading (or listening) to the daily Mass readings has been a great help to me.  I also like having the prayers for the start and end my day.  I consider this to be a must-have app for all busy Catholics.","509":"Doodle jump is sick. I love it! He's so freaking cute!","510":"I needed a good flash card system for my Mandarin vocabulary, and this is everything I could have asked for.  If never heard of Quizlet before, but by enabling the extended keyboard for pinyin, and my Simplified Chinese keyboard, I was easily able to make a custom list of words.  ? (shu?) on one side, and \"water\" on the other for instance.  Inputting them to this app was super easy!  Very well done and totally worth the $4.  Quizlet is free, by the way.","511":"Pixel for pixel, this scanner does better than an expensive HP printer\/scanner. Part of that is the iPhone but the other part is JotNot's software. I use this in my presentations for text off a page. (it doesn't do so well with images though, hence the 4 stars.) taken as a whole, it's money well spent.","512":"Fantastic app ! Makes reading forums so much easier that now I find myself doing it more. Great!!","513":"I like a lot","514":"I think this app works better than using my desktop to use forums. Fast, eat to read, searches well. Wish it had Miniusa and Bike forums... Great for Tacoma World.","515":"If you use forums a lot, you'll love this app!","516":"Excellent","517":"Good","518":"The best App ever!!","519":"You'll love Craigslist pro","520":"I have only purchased a few aps but this for sure is one of them.","521":"Awsome","522":"There are different categories missing since the update. What's wrong with this?","523":"Sweet app. Thank you! I love it!!","524":"Awesome!!!","525":"Need more for finding rental HOUSES. But great other than that!","526":"This app is far better than the usual web interface - intuitive, fast, and great graphics.","527":"I have sold and bought many things using Craigslist.","528":"This app is just like the website, except you have to pick an area instead of having them laid out for you. I love this app and use it every day!","529":"Easy to find what you want and narrow the search.  The photo gallery feature is great when your first filter is how it looks.","530":"Great","531":"Freaking great!","532":"A+","533":"I have used this for over a year and have never been disappointed. The sound quality is excellent on the iPhone.","534":"I will give this app a much higher rating if you fix the Larimer County Fire and EMS...","535":"This app rocks!!!!!","536":"Good app.  Gets me to the info I want quickly, and auto adjusts times to my time zone (many apps don't)","537":"I love this app nothing better for the NASCAR fan!","538":"I love dis right Herre","539":"I have been using this product for 5 days and I love it.  If you are seeking for an app mainly to write school paper, do basic spreadsheet, and reading PDF articles, this is the one.  Of course, you can't compare to iWork apps because they will definitely beat this app in terms of looks and quality (called great marketing).  But if you are a poor student like me, paying student loans, and are seeking for an app mainly to write papers and read docs, I recommend with this one. I have not tried the PowerPoint yet, so I can't say much about it.","540":"I love it","541":"Got this app to be able to share PPT and Word docs. Does not support all of the data from those files. Not happy with it at all. Will try to work with it, but I think it was a waste of time and money!","542":"Great!","543":"great app!","544":"Highly recommend this app to listen to ATC conversations from around the USA and world","545":"VERY WELL","546":"Great app. Works on almost any course. No complaints at all.","547":"Overall fantastic.\n\nThe UI is a little clunky, and things like tapping in the golf ball icon to measure club distance were a little tough to find. It doesn't look like a button.\n\nWish I could view the clubs and look at their performance without starting a round.\n\nStatistics could use some work as well. The charts while fairly easy to read seem disjointed. \n\nNeeds a better social aspect.","548":"\/\/\/Update\/\/\/\n\n149 rounds recorded. iPhone 3GS. Battery 70-80% left after rounds. Still no side game tracking but the notes feature works somewhat for that. Finally fivesomes! Sixsomes! THE BEST APP FOR GOLF!\n\n17 rounds under my belt with this app now and still very happy. The new in-app stats (v.1.3) blew me away!  Still waiting for side games (skins, etc.). I'm confused why so many golfers leave their phone on the entire round? I pull mine out as I'm walking up to my ball, usually while I'm 20-30 yards away, I get positive satellite lock by the time I'm standing over the ball, read my yardage and put the phone back to sleep. After putting I whip it out, score the entire foursome (takes about 15 seconds total) and then put it back to sleep. I consistently have 80-85% battery life after my round is complete.\n\nOnce we get side games\/betting included in a future update I will be even more of a cheerleader for this app!   \n\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nUsed Golfshot for my last 6 rounds and I will continue to use it forever! It's accurate, easy to use, and being able to email your scorecard to your buddies and review actual stats for yourself are perks I didn't know I wanted, but now I can't live without!\n\nEnded up being cheaper to buy a new iPhone 3GS AND this app than the skycaddie I was looking at. Stand alone golf GPS units are in serious trouble.","549":"I have used this App for over 8 months, and is by far, the best golf GPS for the money. I had a sky caddie before, and it was not half as good as this app. Don't waste your money on any of the annual dues GPS units, buy this app and have everything you need. \n\nI have the iPhone 4, and only uses about half the battery during a 4 1\/2 to 5 1\/2 hour round. Turn off your Wi-fi if it is using more battery life than that. \n\nAnyway, must have for all serious golfers.","550":"This app while not perfect (some songs it doesn't) is very good. I use it severalvtimes a week.","551":"I use this every night... It amazes me how little sleep I get most nights. I have made sleeping more of a priority since using it. I can see the difference!","552":"Just what I wanted to know!","553":"Provides for hours of uproarious entertainment!","554":"Great app to keep track of hours. Especially if you're on salary or budgeting.","555":"Great!!!","556":"Thank you for this great resource and thanks to all the readers. Driver","557":"This a great tool for a rapid lab consultation.","558":"Some stories are just down right terrifying. I have had experiences myself. So I can relate. It's a must buy for your iPad, iPhone, iPod!! No joke!","559":"I am a very superstitious person. I love any kind of ghost story. Short, Long, or a book. But this app has everything from short stories to long. Definitely worth the $$","560":"I love This app honestly I don't care if there are mistakes in some stories it's normal. This is app is great! Download now! It's worth 99 cents.","561":"Awesome","562":"Ive sent in a story and i know thi app is BEAST!!!","563":"I'm ten and this stuff does not scare my and I'm  10 YEARS OLD!!!!","564":"Recently used in several European cities and it was GREAT!","565":"Well I have used Magellan it was cool and then I bought a navigon that was the biggest waste of 350 dollars of my life then I used sprint navigation that was fairly accurate so there I have had a couple and this is one of my favorite navigation devices the huge difference is the price 99 cents can't be beaten.     \n\nUpdate to a month and a half later.\nI love this navigation devise have used it more than my factory one I can listen to my music while navigating and it's points of interests rock ! The turn by turn speech and real time traffic is long gone but I don't miss it at all ! If I could give this app more stars I would","566":"good app, but to make it a great app, video would be a great feature. A must need is to make the timer continuous. After the 5 sec. countdown it would be great for it to restart automatically for continuous self shots. Please add that.","567":"The best news, I always check Drudge first for the rest of the story!","568":"Smooth simple app","569":"It's just getting better and better. The signature capture is a huge time saver. Ever wonder how to put your contact info from their email into your Contacts, just copy their signature into this app, it will separate into different fields and put them in your iPhone Contacts. How great!","570":"can't live without my scanners.","571":"Someecards are super funny! They're a great way to give someone a good laugh. Sometimes I just like to look through them because they're fun to read.","572":"Still need to check each, I think I need to improve technique.  Cards with multiple addresses throw it for a loop.  Very easy to export to excel","573":"That says it all.","574":"Love this app! Easy way to keep track of what's in my closet and mix and match pieces. Even better when I got an iPhone so I could take pictures of my clothes and load directly to the app. Perfect for any Fashionista!","575":"Excellent product. Continue development of similar programs for other subject areas.   For instance science, history, Christianity.  Pray for God guidance, America. God bless. BP","576":"Great App for Travelers. Highly recommend it!","577":"Fast and convenient app to search for flights","578":"Great app. even for smaller regional airports.","579":"I use powerOne all the time, whether for a simple conversion, or working out mortgage payments for a new dream house. Highly recommended!","580":"A well engineered multipurpose calculator.  If the extensive template library doesn't have what you need you can easily create your own calculators without a steep learning curve. As a repeat customer since the Palm handheld days, I definitely consider this a great value.  Keep up the good work!","581":"I find that this app does exactly what I wanted it to do- display meaningful data from all the iPhone sensors. Very clear and intuitive interface. It's really the only tool of it's type I need.","582":"Very nice-looking app!","583":"My only complaint with this otherwise wonderful app is the absence of any warning for the bottomless \"hole-in-time\" this thing hides. If you are not very careful, you will fall into this hole (which isn't marked in any fashion by a navigation tool that marks everything else) and your family or friends may lose you. Leave a note and tell them where you went, and don't worry, you'll meet thousands of new friends down in that hole! Finally, I wrote\/chatted with the guy who wrote this - good man and thanks for this jewel!","584":"Best app in the entire world","585":"This app has helped me control my phones battery usage.","586":"It's easy to use. Keeps the battery conditioned for sure.","587":"Does what you need...\nMonitor the cops\nLearn the lingo","588":"Great app, but I  agree, needs more coverage.","589":"I love it, I wish there were more feeds","590":"Nothing like listening in on big brother!","591":"This is so cool. I love how many different frequencies there are to listen to.","592":"Good Job!!!!","593":"This app works wonders. \"Scans\" come out very clear and easy to send items. One of my most used apps!","594":"I use this app for completing my required expense report. Stores pics so you can return to them, pics are super clear. I'd only wish for a two per page option as the scans come back a full page. Overall, only $2. Hell of an app.","595":"This is a great app ...","596":"Good","597":"Love it but it's crashing with the new update!!","598":"my ??wouldnt b the same without it! ??","599":"Best replacement app if your laptop is broken!!","600":"Nuff said ; thanks for the update!!!! Works well for datpiff.com","601":"If u know how to use the app then it's perfect in every way it does what it's supposed to! Worth every penny","602":"Really does what it says -- provides an amazing view of the heavens above your head.","603":"Worth every penny I spent.","604":"No words, just I love it, definetely 3$ very good invested!!!","605":"This is a great educational app for students, especially the movies! It provides a great visual for abstract content.","606":"I finally found my old 3D glasses and took a look at this app again  WOW. A thing of beauty. Mesmerizing!","607":"Love it!","608":"I've purchased 4 different swing apps. This one is by far the best! Great buy!","609":"One of the best ones!","610":"Since signing up I've lost 10 lbs in 2 weeks it's great","611":"Best!!!","612":"Really like this app. It has been soo very helpful in tracking with everything instantly accessible. It really is amazing. Having previously worked in the weight loss industry for many years. I know that this is the key to planning and losing weight. I am doing well with both.","613":"Simple to use. Works flawlessly.  Loads of books to choose from.  I'm a fan.","614":"Really enjoyed this reading. Much better in the car than the junk on the radio.","615":"Nice presentation   Of course, the books come from Librivox and the quality varies according to the talents of the volunteers.  I have found that most of them read well.","616":"The interface works great and mapping is nice :) \n\nOnly bug I've seen is Facebook integration at times.","617":"I've bee using EveryTrail.com for years - loving its ease and look for uploading my rides and embedding the maps on my blog. I used the free app for a long time, until recently on a trip I needed to find a trail and download it to use offline. Enter EveryTrail Pro. This app has practically replaced my GPS unit. I adjust the GPS settings to extend battery life and I can go on epic rides and still have power to text my buddies photos from the trail. I highly recommend it for on the fly trail mapping needs. Worth every penny.","618":"Just got it...  I'm sure it will be used often..","619":"Helps so much with meal planning and grocery shopping.  Cuts time off of both those activities.","620":"A must have if you like to cook.  I think it is great!  Have tried a baked chicken wing recipe and was almost like deep fried.  I'm from Buffalo NY so I know.  Like being able to save Recipes in recipe box on the app. Get this app.","621":"Can't figure out how to modify, add, delete the main recipe folders and titles in the recipe box. Please explain.","622":"This app is amazing! It has helped me so many times!","623":"Great in every way !","624":"I love the pro version - well worth the money. I use it way more than the other cooking apps I have purchased.","625":"So much fun","626":"It is such a helpful app! People of all abilities will love it to help improve and learn!!!","627":"I listen to it a lot. However, it will once in a while disconnect for no apparent reason. When it disconnects, it will repeat previous transmissions. I would like more APD and less Fire and Ambulance. Great app!","628":"love the app ?? but one more problem, please cut down the prices on iWork to 3.99 dollars and the iLife apps to 1.99","629":"Great game, this game is great to pass time","630":"Helpful notations. Wish the illustrations were a bit more defined.","631":"It's great for my anatomy class and I'm sure it'll be helpful in college","632":"Well worth it. Great tool for review and on the spur of the moment reference.","633":":]","634":"Good basic muscle app, worth the $","635":"I actually believe this app is totally awesome in helping me prepare for my boards. However, just as the muscle name is given in audio; I wish there was an option hearing all the muscles info in audio. For me, retaining info comes better in audio, activities, and constant quizzing.","636":"I was very pleased with this app.  The graphics are excellent and the interface is very easy to use and navigate through.  The quiz options and video are a great bonus feature.  I am really satisfied (especially for the price) and look forward to trying out the other systems' software.  Nice Work!","637":"Excellent app, integrates well with Google Reader. A must-have app on all of my iDevices.","638":"Love app easy to use","639":"This product does what it says.","640":"Very helpful in planning trip.","641":"I love this app because it gives you lots of great ideas for your home.","642":"update done for August and not working.  Why","643":"A real lifesaver and eye opener for this iPad newbie.  I learned so much from this app.  Information is well written and easy to understand. Just wish my brain could retain it all for instant recall!","644":"Nice!","645":"Did not give 5 stars because have found not all campgrounds are listed.  Sure is helpful though 99.5% of time.  Have used for gas, reservations for camps, restaurant locations, low clearances.  Awesome!","646":"I was shocked to find the app includes overhead clearances and one can filter that down to what they are worried about.  Looks to be very thorough.  I have not yet tried it on the road but I am amazed at what I can find by sitting her in my house.  I am a little concerned about how much functionality I will find in remote locations with no cell service.  Time will tell.  I may have to update my rating when that situation arises which will be in 4 weeks.  Happy camping everyone!","647":"I love it, every one should have it","648":"When I was a second grader,I kept loosing on the game \"Bingo\".When I play it,I'm a winner.Thank yyy-yyy-??","649":"This application has been a lifesaver! It actually remotely sinks with both my IPhone and IPad . I love it!","650":"Great idea and it works great too!","651":"I love it now i can make people look fat and it is so easy","652":"I live this app so much. It is really really funny. I used it on my whole family and they just started laughing. It is really fun to use when u r bored.","653":"This is the best video editor ever!!! I also like extras for iMovie but the only thing was that I wished I could cut out things people said that I didn't want. Other than that I love it!!!","654":"Intuitive, limitless possibilities. Brings your artistic side out.","655":"This app is very useful!!! It helped me with things","656":"This app is absolutely the best!","657":"The first app I ever bought...and still one of my favorites!","658":"The title says it all...","659":"I love checking in to see the weather forecasts! And it's such a beautiful perspective of our planet!!! It takes me outside of my usual \"local\" mentality.","660":"Its really fun and any age can play it and enjoy it! Will get you busy for a long time!","661":"I think it's a fun and AWSOME game for \"kids\" under 12 years old!!!!!","662":"I added about 150 movies to the app very quickly! Every movie has been in the database.","663":"Great app! Amazing features! Perfect for movie collectors. I love it!","664":"And the fact people are freaking about how real it is is why i give it a 5. It bases its replies off human replies so its very realistic but varies so much.","665":"Great app","666":"Perfect!!!!","667":"The word and we listen to the word of the day and see if we know the meaning or something very close to it. We find it to be an entertaining 'game'. \nSorry!!!  The first part of my review is in the title segment. Bummer. But...CHEERS!!!!!\n5 STARS\nTHE BEST RATING\n10 stars---no, 11 \nBbwwahahahahaha","668":"I'm so impressed with this App! I tell everyone how it benefit & teaches everyday.","669":"Great App to have around... No more need to carry a Dictionary or Thesaurus.","670":"Reader works great though editing on some books is off enough to be  distracting.  Like the user interface and quick loading. Still struggling to figure out how to download (or find) other books as selection is rather limited.","671":"I like the new features that make the product more Stanza-like. I still would like to be able to go directly from the library list to the current place in any given book without having to pass by the TOC page.","672":"Love this app because it helps me keep my finances in order. Easy to use!","673":"I have already submitted a review when I first downloaded stating That this App is the best. Well, yesterday it proved itself. I have a health condition and yesterday I had to go to the hospital. I just emailed myself my list, printed it and was able to give it to doctor. Even the Nurses and Doctors were impressed. \n\nThere is one thing, however, that I think would make this App even better. Add a COMMENT Area so you can write comments regarding yourself or the medications or whatever.","674":"This is easy to use and it helps keep up with meds and allergies for everyone in the household.  I love the med check feature.  It helps me to be a little more knowledgable about things to discuss with my doctor.  Great app!","675":"Dis game Is amazing its 3D affect just adds da thrill of u being in da game!!!!\n(:","676":"Graphics are very nice. The game play is amazing, a lot of quick thinking. Plus you get to upgrade constantly. The one thing that bugs me is how short the game is and the way it repeats itself. That being said, I won't get tired of playing for a while.","677":"Awesome graphics","678":"Told me I was 31 when in 13 very sad app lowers self asteem lol don't get this app it is misleading and very inaccurate do not waste ur time","679":"Cooooool app ??????","680":"It is cool but not on the right age???","681":"This app is a good time. Fun at parties.","682":"Outstanding!  You will enjoy listening to podcats on this app!","683":"I hate iTunes and was looking forward to 'clipping the cord'... What a disappointment that ios5 doesn't update my podcast feeds.  Thanks downcast for doing what iCloud was supposed to.  So worth the $2. Catch up Apple.","684":"If the stars could higher I would rate them as so. Want to be an orthopedic surgeon and this is the best app I've ever came across for learning the skeletal system!!! I would recommend it to anyone from a surgical trainee to a high school A&P student! The best, can't say it enough!","685":"Pretty clever app, works well!","686":"A very fun and easy way to keep up with your heart rate...also quite accurate!!!","687":"This app is a great tool to have for just about all types of foodies.","688":"Great app","689":"I use skritter for learning Japanese and it's an application that requires flash, however I mainly study on my iPhone and probably wouldn't keep up with the SRS if I was only able to access the program on my computer. Thanks to splashtop, now I can practice on the go. (that sounds like a infomercial lol)","690":"Great","691":"Must have","692":"I love this app on my phone and iPad, too. It's accurate and easy to add\/delete cities. I love the graphics, too","693":"Very nice !!!!!","694":"Very helpful in planning my day. Gives hour by hour estimated weather that is just as accurate as any other weather report. Love the graphics behind all of the information. It mostly follows the weather that is expected for the hour which adds a lot of visual interest.","695":"Great app and I live how it gives the sky look for the place I'm checking.","696":"Weather app is awesome and very easy to use!","697":"Very, Very GOOD APP.","698":"99cents can't go wrong. I'd like to have a map feature, but overall it does what it was programmed to do well.","699":"This app is the best!!! The screensavers are so mesmerizing and makes you think you are looking right outside!! I love it!!!","700":"Beautiful display and lots of info instantly","701":"Good ,I like it. Is accurate . And high tech","702":"Good ap but the usage of activity points does not work. Not shown when the add button is selected. Fix this. Other than that, no problem.","703":"Love the learning tool this app provides.","704":"Continues to amaze . . . with information  and views of stellar objects.","705":"It seems like a cool app from what I have been able to see. It crashes everytime I get it open. The free app got me hooked which never crashed. Get this fixed please and I will resubmit a review.","706":"My 4 yr old can't get enough!","707":"This has everything I wanted Craigslist to have but which they NEVER THOUGHT OF!  I love to be able to see the large size pics, circle the ads I like, and cross off the ones I have no interest in.\n\nI haven't tried to upload a picture from my Ipad.  Hope it will do that.  Thanks to whoever developed this ap!!!","708":"I love this app!  Easy to navigate and easy to post to!   One of my favorites!  :)","709":"Im a rap artist because if this","710":"Like the visuals of this app a lot, like how it updates weather as to where you are :)","711":"This ap really is handy and fun.","712":"Without this its literally impossible to play music on my Xbox! Thanks! Happy birthday  ??","713":"Great way to keep up on your crossfit progress.","714":"Excellent app & easy to use, can see where storms are developing and if they are coming. You can play or do one frame at a time.","715":"Very nice radar app. Easy to use","716":"Lots of topics, something for everyone","717":"awesome","718":"Great content. New stuff all the time. Stuff for everyone. Never had a problem with App.","719":"Great app!!","720":"Works great! Maps are good, better than my Garmin. Default is the lowest cache amount so make sure you turn up the cache amount so you don't find yourself without any maps when you lose service. Make sure you scout your area with the maps you want before hunting so it will cache your map area for when you lose service you still can use your cached maps. Best 5 bucks spent for those who want a good hunting GPS.","721":"I love this app it is really handy when u r out in the woods","722":"The new release shows what a mature iOS app should look like. It performs incredibly well, while offering most features (if not all) that users could want. Not only is it now offered at a lower price, but there is an option to enhance the application with an upgrade. Since few users need the enhancements, it is a great way to offer them.","723":"I've been using Marine Traffic for years online and on my iPhone. Downloaded the iPad app and it's as simple (good thing) as always and the content is great. I only give it 4 stars because it needs Retina support which would make it excellent.","724":"Love the app, use it all the time to check shipping activity in Puget Sound. Helpful whether on land or on the water.","725":"Great app.","726":"Really like this app. It is a very easy way to journal","727":"I have Day One on both my iOS devices, and my Mac. It just works beautifully, seamlessly, and smoothly.\n\nAdd simple photo function, and you'll rule the journal app world. \n\nFive star!","728":"This is cool app I've used before.. but no search function.. ^^;; \n\nI need it much..","729":"This app is awesome and makes recording everything so easy, the only thing I can request is to make it compatible with iPads!","730":"I have been a P90X client for some time now and love the workout!  With the P90X app I now have the option of taking my workout to the gym or with me when I travel. Plus the nutrition journal makes it easier for me to keep track of what I eat during the day. For me it is a great app! Glad I purchased this app!","731":"I LOVE this game!!! Please add more options like a curler and much more stuff! I really want there to be a update!!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh and add MORE characters!!!","732":"I love it- it's fun to play on boring car rides?","733":"Great app for viewing weather.","734":"It's as accurate as any weather forecaster who gets paid good money for often being 100% wrong. So far this app has been close enough to allow me to dress appropriately so who cares about too much scientific input. I just don't want to be carrying an umbrella when the sun is shining.","735":"Best CL app I've ever used, by far.","736":"Easy to use","737":"Great Craigslist app","738":"Great little app to have on phone. Handy for those spur of the moment shopping sprees.  And easy to use to list items also.","739":"App hasn't worked in a month. That shows no effort in trying to fix this. You all failed.","740":"I just want my money back!!","741":"Works yo.","742":"Awesome ????????","743":"Love it","744":"This is a great app. I've used ODB on my iPod Touch and then my iPhone before I got an iPad 2. Each version is more refined. I like the way that the app remembers my choice of Bible version (currently 'The Message') when I tap on the Scripture for the day. This isn't the case with the iPhone app. One always has to change the version from the default.\n\nThere are a couple formatting issue suggestions:\n\n1. The poem at the bottom of the page is almost never formatted like the online website. It would be nice if the lines were stacked and not simply strung out in a row.\n2. One of the things I've always enjoyed are the cover photos. The cover for the current month shows in the upper righthand corner, but there is no way to enlarge it. One would think that a simple double-tap could bring up the cover art full screen?\n3. When traveling I don't always have a wifi link, so having issues cached is nice. In those instances I simply use my Bible app (or print version) to get the Scripture for the day. I don't expect (or want) ODB to cache the Scripture from Biblegateway.com on my device, but it would be nice if there was a way in the app set-up to direct the ODB app to my Olivetree app onboard for the Scripture of the day. May be too difficult for what is already an elegant app.\n\nKeep up the good work!","745":"I have used this on countless occasions now. It has come in handy, and when I do use it the other party is as \"wowd\" as I was the first time. I gave 4 stars because the speech is a bit quirky (may be iPhone speech recognitions problems) and because it is a translator it breaks a sentence down funny. But, if you type or talk like a caveman it gets the point across every time. Overall very pleased with this for just a buck!","746":"I am truly amazed at how well this app works..the thing that stands out to me the most is the fact that when I am recording my voice for translation, IT ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS ME!! I have a very deep voice and I have never had any type of software that was able to take what I said and convert it to the correct version..I am very very very pleased with this app..you should get it ??","747":"The adjustments in Snapseed are very good and it's simple to learn and use. However, I'm not a fan.  The tools are very specific purpose and I find myself constantly moving back and forth from one limited purpose tool to another. If you like a good sample of adjustments presented at one time, in one place and on screen at all times, Snapseed may not be what you're looking for.","748":"Best Post-Edit App that I've tried to date. Advanced features rival and even exceed that of Camera+ (which I also love). I did grab this free during a promo, but even at $4.99 this ones worth the splurge.","749":"Solid, but weird volume settings,","750":"Even better than the real thing!","751":"I was looking for a good nightstand application and instead found a great app. Separate alarms, separate days, wake to music, slide dimmer. All around great app.","752":"Awesome app!!!!","753":"Very handy, makes a workout possible anytime.","754":"Easy to use","755":"Really Great!","756":"This is so very helpful!  I like it a lot.","757":"I am a nursing student and this lab reference is the best I have ever seen or used! It has helped me understand the labs so much! I highly recommend the app!!!","758":"Very helpful for the home health nurse in the field.","759":"Clinilab Navigator, Lab Tests Online, Medline Plus, and WebMD for more information. Thousands of commonly used abbreviation","760":"i realy like app","761":"The app is probably the best music app  on the app store.","762":"I use this app every day i love it i dont no what i do without it","763":"Love","764":"I love the app but it's annoying cause when I use the premade hats they come half out with the middle half of the hat gone so I can't make what I want easily.","765":"Great","766":"Guud","767":"Go to mp3skull.com\nOne of my favorite apps.","768":"I love this app! \nMusic on top of music ?","769":"Very practical, easy, and for all music lovers.","770":"Love this app!!!  I use it often and it is dependable.","771":"Gets better and better with every update. Thank you for this app. Much appreciated.","772":"I wanted an App that would separate my videos from my photo library.  I wanted to be able to play my photo slideshow without interruption from annoying videos.  The music stops and you have to start it over. Now the videos are on this app and I can play right through all my pictures.  Love it!","773":"Very nice app","774":"Gives hourly weather for the day too!","775":"Does everything I would need a simple weather app to do. Radar is slow to load, but I have another app for that. There's not a lot of detail in the information, particularly in details for upcoming days. The forecast is no more specific than a high and low temp and a picture representation of the weather for the entire day. Nevertheless, this isn't meant to be too detailed, and it provides plenty of info for the current time. My biggest complaint is that the app crashes on startup often. Sometimes it will load the second time, sometimes it requires a restart of my iPad 3rd generation. It's a nice looking app, the kind that you would want to have on your iPad, it just has a stability problem.","776":"Really good !","777":"Good App","778":"Best one so far, thanks","779":"Great app! Couple suggestions for the next update though. Add a way to see the degree of angles and also it would be great to actually be able to have two videos side by side to compare.","780":"One of my favorite apps!","781":"I love laying in bed at night an watching the stars! Almost as cool as the real thing living in the city :)","782":"This is a great site love the stars. Now I can see them in the daytime too.","783":"Great app","784":"This is a very useful tool when posting animal that I have up for adoption!","785":"A must-have for students, or anyone who wants to improve their word power!","786":"Funny!","787":"Neat app","788":"So fun\/funny love it! Did it with friends and family so funny and old! LOL","789":"This app rules","790":"Love it","791":"Awesome","792":"It guesses is every time! Got all of one direction even Cher Lloyd! I love this app??????","793":"Great app for news on demand. No wasted screens to navigate through. Would give it 5th star if there was a button to close the app. Love NPR!","794":"Simple enough to use and I love the recurring transactions. No more forgetting and figuring out how to balance my checkbook every month. The other reason I got the app is because it can export to Quickbooks although I have not used that feature yet. The reports are great. Would love to be able to have main categories and sub-categories. That's the only thing missing in my opinion to make this a truly robust stand-alone financial management app. Keep up the good work!","795":"But make more apps! (People apple does not allow to open all apps directly, (only if the developer of app make it in code)) The launch of apps without safari is not possible! An some apps possible but still not faster.","796":"Best shoe app ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Correct dates and prices! Let's me know every thing about the shoe!??","797":"This app is the best app ever","798":"Excellent addition to the Angry Birds games. Great new features, challenges and visuals. If you are an Angry Birds fan, this is definitely worth it. The new \"orbit\" launching is very neat and a nice, innovative twist on the game. It's definitely harder... At least in my opinion, which is a good thing. Get it.","799":"This game is the best","800":"Lovee them ;) <3","801":"Love it. Keeps me occupied while i have d time to wait","802":"Like!!!","803":"This helps me keep track of all my budgets that I've set up (groceries, gas, rent, etc) and also has tons of graphs that compare my income vs expenses. Very easy to use and it's already helping me save my money.","804":"Just wish I knew how to center the text!","805":"Its kewl","806":"Love this app don't let me forget Birthdays.","807":"Ok people...this app works and if you are too stupid to figure out how to make something so simple work, you shouldn't own a smart phone, especially the iPhone. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the addition of all the contacts. Looking forward to future updates. ????????","808":"I never have to take a foreign language class again!!","809":"Itranslater 1.0 is a good app but sometimes it dose't work out as you plan it to that is why I only rate it 4 stars rather than 5","810":"Very helpful!!","811":"Great!!!!!","812":"Best app I ever had","813":"Great app!","814":"I absolutely love this app!!!","815":"So fun. Once I got the hang of tweaking the disease I had a great time playing.","816":"It needs a few things like some more cheats and another game mode:Zombies or instead just call it \"walking dead syndrome\" superb app, though","817":"5 stars.","818":"Best game on the i-phone!","819":"Great","820":"Its so funny i love this","821":"This app is great. Presents challenges for all ages. Quick yet stimulating. Only wish there was another level to play cuz its super addictive.","822":"I like it","823":"Many options, easy to use, show it off on instagram and Facebook!","824":"Good reference for a quick review.. Doesn't take away from the manuel but excellent resource for refreshing our minds on ACLS.","825":"Amazing game. It's so much fun and I'm totally addicted. Highly recommend it for everyone!","826":"Daddy like!","827":"I love this app. Its so easy to learn how to use it and its very easy to understand. The only thing I don't like is that if you choose the option to show what the temp feels like, you can't see what the temp actually is. I would love to be able to see both at the same time.","828":"Fix it!  How many times do I have to send you the crash report before you fix the app? \n\nUntil its fixed, I dislike this app","829":"I've used this app for three seasons! This is the first year that NFL owns it. I've drafted 8 teams over those years with this app! Very user friendly.","830":"Takes a minute to get use to it. But with a snake draft. It is the perfect app. Loved it and was happy with my picks. Didn't have to turn pages on a magazine to find my next pick.","831":"Cant go wrong","832":"Very fun!!! Love it!!!","833":"nice app   beautiful","834":"Great app","835":"But i wish u could use it offline","836":"Best","837":"amazing if only some was free","838":"We always use this app as we are always looking for great places to eat. We don't cook a lot so we look for variety in the places we try. This app never disappoints!","839":"I fell in love with this app in 2009 when I was in San Fran for the first time. With this app, we found a wonderful restaurant right around the corner and wouldn't have known to go there otherwise. I generally don't eat anywhere less than 80%. Good job team, very useful info!","840":"Very useful, no complaints!","841":"This app is very helpful in my line of business.","842":"Great app. Use it all the time.","843":"It is alright.","844":"Love it","845":"I use my Yelp app daily and frequently for everything.  Love it.  Only gave 4 stars because of the loss in functionality.  Why can't I publish reviews with app, why don't we earn open table points using app?","846":"Love it","847":"Lots of fun. Great learning tool.m","848":"Very easy to use !!!","849":"Best app!","850":"Very detailed gps even tracks laps at my local park","851":"I can't find the clipboard once I save a word to it. If anyone knows how to find saved words let me know through the review. Otherwise great app.","852":"It was my best dictionary resource for 4 months, until it started crashing, and freezing, and ARRRRRRRGGG!!!","853":"Great app. I use it over and over again.","854":"It would be even better if you could drive an airplane.","855":"Best app ever","856":"Love this site it nails every question I have ever asked.very helpful and resourceful.once I found i could download this app for my phone it made it so much more convienant for us.my family goes by it and we love it!","857":"This app is so fantastic, I actually find it even better than the website. It is easy to navigate, easy to modify reservations. There is an option to add it to your calendar and it puts all the information right in your phone calendar. You can invite your co-diners easily through the app (it creates an email for you). A great part is that you can filter your search by 1000 point tables only, by neighborhoods within a city, by distance to you, and so much more. I use this app on a regular basis- so much that I'll make a reservation we just decided to go to so that it's easier when we get there! It's such a great app (and business) that I always wonder why some restaurants don't have it!","858":"Love this app, use it all the time!  Never a problem or any difficulties.","859":"We use open table all the time!  Love this app!!!","860":"This app is the best, so helpful","861":"Great app, definitely very useful.","862":"Love it","863":"Great perfect love it","864":"Lots of measurements and long term forecasts.","865":"Mint is a great way to get control of your finances. It really helps you reign in your spending and makes you aware of what you spend your money on. I love the trending charts!","866":"Worst app in the world. Same news stories from a week ago. used to be great but some GENIUS decided to update it. FAIL!!!!!! no point in having it now. Just takes up space and memory.","867":"Makes reading even more fun when you get rewards! Love the convenience of downloading a book and being able to read on my phone, iPad and computer. Extra bonus, it's free :)","868":"Free books? Love it","869":"Syncing is a bit tricky at first, but otherwise wonderful. Reading interface is fab!","870":"I remember when this app was totally worthless exactly a year ago, when it did not work at all but now this is a huge comeback for ustream, being able to have a native iPad app is great I was getting tired of having to go the website directly. Have no problems so far good job,","871":"Seems cool","872":"AWSOME cool","873":"Incredible !!!","874":"this is a pretty good app. great to be free. it is super slow on load time. that needs to be fixed. also change the default time. it's so annoying because sometimes I forget to change it and dont see all my hw. also push notofications would be wonderful! other than that it's great. I'm a sophomore math major taking 20 hours and this app helped me stay on top of things!","875":"After the last update I'm VERY happy with the new features, thanks!","876":"good~~","877":"Love this site.  So much info at your fingertips.  Watched a video on a procedure prior to surgery and it was comforting.  Thanks!","878":"Quick, easy booking and best prices!","879":"As an author, I definitely nee something like this on the go. It's nice not having to wait until I get home to type the next chapter of my book, and I don't have to carry around my binder full of notebook paper. This is amazing ad extremely convenient!!","880":"Defiantly my most used app I stay on it constantly :)","881":"U can read books and u don't even need wifi I luv it! U can also post books that u wrote your self","882":"cannot pay my Directv bill, bah humbug!","883":"A great app at hands reach. The pronunciation button is a useful tool when unsure of the proper pronunciation of a word. Also, multiple definitions are given to insure you are using the word in its true context.","884":"This is da best app eva","885":"By the end of the story, I wanted to meet the reader! Why a great app!","886":"This app is great for road trips. The kids can listen to their music and I can put on headphones and listen to my books.","887":"I LOVE this app, super easy interface and I use it ALL the time.","888":"I didnt really like the first one but i looooovvvveee the updated one cause you can rotate the text box and the stencils are really good!!!! You have to get this app!!!!?","889":"I think it is a great app","890":"It's the best","891":"Helps me lots when I'm on the road a spending nights away from home. Helps me get\/stay sleeping.","892":"Great app.  No bugs.  Thoughtful, provoking news.","893":"Thanks for the thought & effort that went into creating this app.  Very handy for those of us that love the outdoors & natures transitions.","894":"I think it is very helpful to me being a first semester nursing student. I believe it will help me in level two with applying knowledge to diseases.","895":"As a retired M.D., I was looking for a concise, yet easily activated program which gave me good access to a complete illness entity, from dx to rx.  The treatment medications have changed or have been forgotten, and the ease of reference is remarkable.  Thanks   JLA  Wis.","896":"Loved it!","897":"Easy to use. I wished it was able to determine what hole you were on.","898":"Very easy to use","899":"I recently used this app during Hurricane Isaac. This app refreshed faster and was much more reliable than the other two with the big websites. Get it. You may need it when it counts. I did.","900":"Travel all d Eastern us and use this frequently to stay abreast of weather conditions","901":"I've used several flashcard aps in the past and this is by far the best.","902":"Good job!!","903":"This app is good, but very confusing and hard to navigate at first. The review sheet doesn't make any sense, but good app, overall","904":"Very nice. Better if map would center on my location automatically when I trim app on.","905":"Accurate and easy to use. I highly recommend it.","906":"I love this app! No more waiting for checks in the mail. I can take credit cards immediately. Good pricing too","907":"This app is cool for DA 46 hours den yhu need to pay money.! -_- make it free & ill share ya on fb & twitter & yhu guys can be da number 1 APP.! :) plzzz","908":"Will definitely download and re-rate as 5 stars when this is fixed. Unusable if you want that option, which is why I give 1 star.  Dont bother putting brown rice in the special secrion as it may be missed.  Great way to order and avoid any miscommunication with staff.

I can't access my program now. Will cancel if problem is not fixed soon!","917":"I've never had a problem with this app. It works fine and I haven't had it glitch or freeze on me. I really like it. I do wish i could search more recipes from the app. I've been having to go to the website to get more recipes, which isn't a problem, but it also isn't as convenient as accessing them from the app.","918":"I love my CNN. Use it every day to access info. Very ingenious design. User friendly. This is a bit of brilliance in my opinion.","919":"that's all amazing awesome... pretty cool... love it... ????","920":"Always get great comments about my photo editing!! Thanks so much!!!","921":"This is such an awesome app to use if you want to communicate in a fun way!! I recommend this app to you ????","922":"Funny and informative.","923":"Great for uploading receipts on the go. Easier than reconciling on the computer.","924":"Good app when it comes to travel. However, more photos would really help in the future.","925":"This is so convenient!","926":"I sat down and worked out the equiv. IQ for each category based on the data given and Average professional college IQ used for this program 119.985 ~120.\n\nIt would be really nice to get an integrated IQ-Equiv feature that showed us this information like the excel calculator I made for myself.\n\nKeep up the great work!","927":"The app is great! Whoever created the app for the post office did a wonderful job!","928":"This App works well and has helpful traffic information.","929":"Still old school and use a map and compass. I do like to use this app when I have gone hiking in the mountains.  So far it has done what I wanted and finding more applications with the app that I like.","930":"Very good!","931":"Love this app!  Very accurate. Quick response.","932":"Cool tool. Works fast. Smooth. Boring backgrounds. And it would be mice to be able to it the compass rose for a better look. But all in all very nice app. Thanks.","933":"Great way to save!  Thank u","934":"Great app. Wish the instant deals were more varied but otherwise great deals to be had.","935":"Simply put. Just plain good.","936":"Would totally give 5 stars if u didn't have to use the app by itself & send from there! Would be nice to be able to choose app from inside text message or email! Can u work on that?","937":"First of all, both Dragon Dictation and Dragon Search are amazing and I'm using the slow 3G. They're beyond amazing on my wife's iPhone 4! As a heavy user of Dragon Dictation, it would be very useful to be able to clear the screen and start new, perhaps by shaking the iPhone. Sometimes it's easier to start over rather than edit out one word.","938":"Keep the news and updates coming","939":"Very cool app it does what it saids","940":"Love being able to work on my phone or laptop. My family tree is always up to date.","941":"Using for a few days now. Easy to navigate and understand. Love it.\nHope it stays free.","942":"This app is great, but don't start with it unless you have plenty of time, it is addictive.","943":"Great app, huge selection of titles, and great free section with plenty of releases semi-monthly\/monthly. Only problem is the viewer occaisonally hangs up but not often and restarting the app usually remedies this. Overall, one of the best apps in the entire app store.","944":"Best App Ever Made.","945":"Always a big help, love your video of the venese beach wax king selection","946":"Love this app!!!","947":"Love this App!! Gives you locations and deals and everything you need!! Definitely amazing.","948":"Excelente aplicaci\u00f3n..","949":"Stupid app","950":"The concept is very interesting. For the most part it's very accurate at recognizing your hand-written numbers and operators entered for calculation. I would definitely recommend it.","951":"LOVE IT.  From excursion with the kids to experiencing new eateries I've save a lot of money.  I try and take advantage of the huge savings on massages and good.  It's AWESOME!","952":"This is huge","953":"Helps with the hard to find SoNGs...\"","954":"So glad I open it b4 I did (:","955":"This is one of my very FAVORITE apps. I tell everyone I know about it. If you are a music lover you'll love it. I really like that it even gives the lyrics to the song & shows other songs\/ music by the same musician(s). Our children love it too. It's great. Thank you","956":"Just great. I like Shazam too, but don't always want my friends to know the cheesy songs I'm looking up. I choose this one! :)","957":"I love this app!","958":"This app works very well.","959":"Great App!","960":"Great UI that aggregates so much information into one place, great app! Super intuitive to use.","961":"I would of given it a 5 if I could pin on Pinterest from it.","962":"This is so amazing ...awesome ...it's everything to me!!!","963":"This is one of my favorite apps! I was abandoned by my dad with a dead mom, and got caught stealing from a bread shop, got sent to Australia, learned to cook and sew, then married a builder.

It's the best!!","971":"Best reading app by far!   Love the NOOK reading app on my iPad!  Thanks for a great reading app.","972":"A+++","973":"This app works like a charm. Don't have to spend the extra time finding an available associate.","974":"Had it on my iTouch and it was great. Got it on my iPad... Not so great. What the heck apple? I don't want to look at pixelated stuff in your store. Would be convenient to have an update...","975":"Please read the instructions to make sure your school is on the list for this app.  It seems like everyone who marked this app poorly because they couldn't log in, didn't bother to read the instructions!!!! It clearly states your school's system must be enabled for this app to work.","976":"Family Guy AND South Park!

Pleaseee!!!!","993":"It's good and easy to use.","994":"Couldn't be better really, with options to copy results and also send via text\/email..  would like to see an option for viewing results full-screen, sometimes the end gets cut off.. but it still copies\/pastes all of it so it's cool ;)","995":"I love these quotes. Only wish the quotes could appear in my notifications area. I'd pay for a full version!","996":"EVERYONE FIRST OF ALL GET THIS APP IF U HAVE A FANTASY TEAM AND YES U CAN MAKE TRADES. GO TO STANDINGS CHOOSE THE TEAM U WANT TO TRADE WITH AND THEN PRESS PROPOSE TRADE AT TOP OF SCREEN!!!!!!","997":"I have so many apps through my iPhone and this is the worst one I've ever used! It deletes messages that I dont delete, doesn't send messages that I send, and doesn't even save my favorites when I click to save them! Truly horrible. I really hope you guys upgrade and soon because it's making it pointless for me to be on the site...","998":"I'm giving the NFL '12 v3 update three stars largely because it's an improvement over the previous version. The in-game display is better organized, and the \"Scores\" page is vastly superior to the prior version: you can now see all games for the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list. After a modest amount of use, the app appears much more stable.\n\nHowever, it still needs work in many respects. The scoring summary is gone (so far as I can tell); I often found this helpful when checking up on games that I wasn't following play-by-play. The \"team leaders\" appears limited to only 1 QB (passing), 1 player rushing, and 2 receivers, with no apparent way to scroll through players or pull up a full listing. Especially during the preseason games, when teams are running through multiple personnel packages, this is very frustrating--there's no way (for example) to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs who have gotten playing time. A more egregious problem is that (at least for the Thursday games in week 2), the teams do not switch properly: checking on the Atlanta vs. Cincinnati game, if I tap on the \"Atlanta Falcons\" button, I get the passing stats for A. Dalton; if i tap on the \"Cincinnati\" button I see the passing stats for M. Ryan (with the rushing and receiving stats for their teams). I'm hoping this is an operator error that will be fixed shortly, but it reflects poorly on the product. (I apologize for the comments length, I'm hoping that the NFL is monitoring this feedback.)","999":"I find this app very useful. It has mechanism and class info that most of the other free programs are missing. You can't do much better (esp for free)!","1000":"Great","1001":"This app is awesome!","1002":"It works perfect for me.","1003":"Its a totally convenient way to manage your teams. All the bad reviews are bogus!","1004":"Great app, always works and is spot on!","1005":"Addicting!!!!!!!!!and you help Susan G Komen for the cure","1006":"I love it access to everything on your phone","1007":"Great  App,and helpful.","1008":"Addicting!","1009":"You should make more updates on how to make stuff.      ;)","1010":"Every time I use it, it crashes. If I don't use for 25 days, pinger says they will give away my number. Terrible app.","1011":"This is awesome and help me alot. and i love it.","1012":"Great and handy app. Love how you can listen to the pronunciation.","1013":"I love that this app takes less than ten seconds to let you know where your battery life is!!! I love it.","1014":"Would definitely recommend this to any one","1015":"This app is one of the most useful apps I have!  The flexibility to insert and organize decks, the syncing with other devices, and the ability to dictate in notes is awesome!!!","1016":"Love this app. It was really cool to be able to download existing decks from quizlet. Saved me from having to make 158 flash cards to study for the CM level 8 piano exam! Thank you flashcardlet!","1017":"Don't change a thing","1018":"I love it :) so helpful with how I study! Paperless, and I can study from my phone ANYWHERE!","1019":"Very useful and the creator did a good job","1020":"Absolutely awesome!!!  One of the most beautiful \"free\"  apps. Thanks :)","1021":"Great weather, eazy to understand.","1022":"Very detailed","1023":"This app made searching very easy, and quick. Get this app","1024":"At 47 my eyes are not that good. This really works very well.","1025":"Great and useful app. I have nothing bad at all to say about it. It helps me find the best deals on gas around the city with little to no glitches. Does what it's supposed to. 5 stars!","1026":"Always completely up to date.","1027":"I have used this app locally, as well as while traveling.  Sometimes it's off, but for the most part, it works great.","1028":"No matter where I travel, it's very accurate to use.","1029":"I like it.","1030":"Fort lauderdale. Il Lugano is making us feel like royalty!  Friendly, and bending over backward to relax us at the end of a long travel day.  Great app with great hotels!","1031":"Great","1032":"Particularly like the reminder!","1033":"Accurate","1034":"Out of a dozen attempts I made on my iPhone 4, I was able to get it to work three times. And even then it was frustratingly inconsistent in recognizing a pulse. I'm not sure what the indication is that it's reading your heart rate, as the \"dial\" moves around and then restarts constantly. Sometimes a blinking heart shows up. The instructions don't explain what the dial and heart icon are for. Keeping my finger in the same location would reveal a heart rate of 85... and then 31.\n\nWatched the video on their website to look at the location of my finger in comparison to theirs--same spot. It's possible that the technique they use to measure the heart rate doesn't work on everyone--thus the vast disparity in ratings for the app. Seems to work for some people and not for others.\n\nDoesn't work at all on my iPad 2 even in good lighting.","1035":"I absolutely love this app. I scan whatever I see....","1036":"Awsome App , I Love Using This App :D","1037":"VERY easy to use, and I've found a ton of cool stuff getting into QR codes!! HIGHLY recommended","1038":"Super original application great!!!!!","1039":"Love how it looks! Not sure where it gets the info from or how accurate it is? But this is the beat looking weather out there!","1040":"Visually stunning but the ads are annoying sometimes.","1041":"Great and easy.use it everyday","1042":"Great app","1043":"This app is so convenient! I looovvve it!!","1044":"Now that I have this app I can't imagine how I got anywhere without it. In my experience it's approx 98% accurate and the spoken directions are a necessity when you're driving alone. One improvement would be to have the spoken directions a little earlier especially on a busy highway. I'd recommend this app to anyone looking for reliable accurate directions.","1045":"Awesome! The real deal!","1046":"Somehow I lost my contacts. This app got everything back for me","1047":"Mediocre!! It's primitive!!!","1048":"Finally. A secure place for my private photos. No more worrying about things being accidentally seen. Buy this.","1049":"Awesome app.","1050":"Absolutely handy for those pics you don't need everyone else to see.","1051":"Great app especially for fantasy news.

I have difficulty picking out what I should cook for dinner, but this app gives you recipes based on what meat you want to cook AND THEN it generates a shopping list for you to print! I'm much less stressed now that dinner planning is made simple and quick with this app!","1063":"Easy to use....love French...using French stations to improve my French.\nIt's working!!!  Merci, merci!!!","1064":"Nice features for a freebie!","1065":"Great App!!!","1066":"Decent app. Finally, notifications are here.

I'm so glad I found it!","1087":"No biggie.. Nothing to get excited about.","1088":"I love keek","1089":"Good\nApp","1090":"For those asking how to make a new when after you have already created one...after you post it and you're ready for a new one, tap the collage twice and it takes you back to the layout screen do you can insert new pics.","1091":"Great App :3","1092":"Very useful!","1093":"Love This App!!

Extremely well done. I show this app to everyone!","1096":"It needs improvement","1097":"Only thing I would like added is the semester dates.","1098":"It just needs to play the next song after one ends and it will definetely get the 5 stars","1099":"great items. Fast, easy ordering. Love fab.","1100":"I have made many purchases from FAB and have been mostly very satisfied. The offerings are unique and of good quality. But don't expect your stuff in a hurry as many items are handcrafted. One criticism is that there are not multiple views of the items and the descriptions are somewhat lacking.","1101":"THIS APP IS A GREAT APP ?????????\nUSE MY BONUS CODE: cherryx3
