my third re installing, it finally has scenery. Before hand, it was just black shapes everywhere. I could not even see the walls. This killed my internet as it is a very big game that takes half an hour to install - if you don't like the game, their is no chance of a refund. Once I finally got the proper game, it is very pretty with smooth graphics, an amazing sound track, and some of the best scenery I've ever seen on my tablet. In the next update, I want to be seeing the right installment first time, a chance of a refund, and free roam! Free roam was the best part of the old games, I would love to have it on my tablet! Thank you ?","1":"Does exactly what it says on the tin\tEffecient enough to check and respond to my emails","2":"Best of what's available\tI've purchased a few of these word emulator apps and Office Suite is the best. It's very easy to edit with the toolbars. I would give it a five but there are some word spacing issues and I've lost edits occasionally when saving to Dropbox","3":"Finally an Office Suite which works great\tI have gone through so many office suite and tried to find the suite which best support most common Microsoft Office suite applications. Finally this suite fills that suite to 80%. If the Font package was part of the suite then I would have given 95% and 5 star.","4":"Pretty good!\tI've edited many photos using this application already. Something to probably address is the photo not always saving what you're looking at in the preview. The beautify tool is a good example of this, as it may look fine in preview, but when you save it, you don't exactly get the same quality. Sometimes it turns out a little pixalated, but overall a remarkable app! I use this in conjunction with other apps.\r","5":"Aside from the occasional glitch, pretty good\tAwesome graphics, nice sound, just don't expect AC3 or 4 scale naval warfare. The battles are not what I'd call real time, more a cross between real and turn based. Randomly sailing about is also quite pointless due to being able to fast travel almost anywhere. The main missions and races are fun however as they are much less repetitive than battling. There have been a few bugs but the developer seems to be squashing them quite often.","6":"Great app\tFound my Canon MX880 printer.   Worth the money as none of the other free applications worked to my liking.\r","7":"I  like using this application for my embroidery business.\tEnjoy using this application for my business.","8":"Funny\tFunny and exciting app. You can can have new way of expressing yourself and you can make fun with others photos..","9":"Works\tI needed a app that allowed me to print to my house using my wifi. This app worked perfectly and easy to setup. Make sure you share your printer if using a home network and an install all the drivers for that printer. If not may have issues.\r","10":"The best!\tI really like the features especially the stickers ?","11":"Awesome PDF performance\tLatest update has improved PDF viewing performance by a significant amount. No more waiting for the content to appear while swiping through pages.","12":"Love it!\tI really love this game, game play is amazing and for this being a mobile based game the graphics are stunning.","13":"Beautiful\tKeep it up.. this far is the most usable app editor.. it makes my photos more beautiful and alive..","14":"Just the link needed\tPerfect solution for my Android \/ Linux environment. Works well with Tasker.","15":"Excellent\tFrom the developers of the best file manager for android. Works like a charm on my S4, Droid Razr and Note II.\r","16":"Easy to find songs and purchase in iTunes.","17":"Having fun. I never had much interest in astronomy, but this app has changed everything.","18":"Lots of fun to use... We live in a unpopulated area and it's neat to pick out which stars are what. The app works very well!","19":"I use this app almost every weekend while exploring back roads and trails by motorcycle. Functionality is excellent while on the road as well as using the data to review later using Google Earth. \n\nI've tried all the GPS tracking apps and this is the one I go back to every time. \n\nI strongly recommend reading the users guide and watching the videos. 10 minutes spent learning the app will really pay off in how much use and function you get out of the app.","20":"I cannot believe how amazing the new changes are. If you mountain bike, hike, camp, or travel this is a must need app! It now tracks altitude, pace, speed, and about every other stat you need in any unit of measure. By far this is the best app I have!","21":"This is, hands down, the most useful app. I had the lite version but decided it was worth the money to upgrade. It makes it so much easier than the guess and check on the calendar. I love it!!","22":"Love it's multifunctionality. Able to do multiple business and year prior expenses etc!","23":"This ap is great, really puts your collection at your fingertips! I really like how easy it is to manage your wine collection, buying, drinking or storage notes. Love it!","24":"This app is beast! The best thing is, is that it doesn't need Internet! Because I have an iPod touch so I don't have Internet on it in public. I recomend  this app!","25":"This is a great little app especially for those with hectic schedules it keeps you in like for visual people like me.","26":"Live sky does not work on my touch. Also, doesn't find my correct locAtion. So close to being like the Droid app...but off by a parsec.","27":"I keep tabs on my brother's flight info,  as he travels for work quite a bit. I'm a worrier by nature, so it's wonderful to be able to see the progress of his flights. I've always been able to pull them up easily & they've always been accurate. Great job!","28":"It's a pure joy already having a pic when your friends call and sometimes contacts info from your FB friends that you haven't taken the time out to acquire. Fabulous!","29":"At first I didn't have the challenges on and literally got board in about 10min. But when I turn the challenges on I was all over it like a hawk of a dead animal. So to get to the point BETER THAN MODERN COMBAT 3!!!!!!","30":"Great app to have for tracking flights! I own a limousine company & all my drivers use it to track their clients flights.","31":"Easy to use and very accurate. A must for any traveler!","32":"I just finished up a weekend of playing and it was the first time I have used this product. I was more than impressed with it! The setlist option was my favorite part. We played several different times throughout the weekend and being able to program the songs into setlist form made it super easy to transition between songs. I highly recommend this product and can't wait to use it again!","33":"Great for daily readings. I love it.","34":"This is an excellent app to use in the daily devotional reading of the mass readings.  Well done!","35":"What a bargain for all the benefits I receive daily from this app!!  The audio is especially good to have.  Reading (or listening) to the daily Mass readings has been a great help to me.  I also like having the prayers for the start and end my day.  I consider this to be a must-have app for all busy Catholics.","36":"Fantastic app ! Makes reading forums so much easier that now I find myself doing it more. Great!!","37":"I think this app works better than using my desktop to use forums. Fast, eat to read, searches well. Wish it had Miniusa and Bike forums... Great for Tacoma World.","38":"If you use forums a lot, you'll love this app!","39":"Sweet app. Thank you! I love it!!","40":"Awesome!!!","41":"Need more for finding rental HOUSES. But great other than that!","42":"I have sold and bought many things using Craigslist.","43":"This app is just like the website, except you have to pick an area instead of having them laid out for you. I love this app and use it every day!","44":"Easy to find what you want and narrow the search.  The photo gallery feature is great when your first filter is how it looks.","45":"Great","46":"I have used this for over a year and have never been disappointed. The sound quality is excellent on the iPhone.","47":"Good app.  Gets me to the info I want quickly, and auto adjusts times to my time zone (many apps don't)","48":"I love this app nothing better for the NASCAR fan!","49":"\/\/\/Update\/\/\/\n\n149 rounds recorded. iPhone 3GS. Battery 70-80% left after rounds. Still no side game tracking but the notes feature works somewhat for that. Finally fivesomes! Sixsomes! THE BEST APP FOR GOLF!\n\n17 rounds under my belt with this app now and still very happy. The new in-app stats (v.1.3) blew me away!  Still waiting for side games (skins, etc.). I'm confused why so many golfers leave their phone on the entire round? I pull mine out as I'm walking up to my ball, usually while I'm 20-30 yards away, I get positive satellite lock by the time I'm standing over the ball, read my yardage and put the phone back to sleep. After putting I whip it out, score the entire foursome (takes about 15 seconds total) and then put it back to sleep. I consistently have 80-85% battery life after my round is complete.\n\nOnce we get side games\/betting included in a future update I will be even more of a cheerleader for this app!   \n\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nUsed Golfshot for my last 6 rounds and I will continue to use it forever! It's accurate, easy to use, and being able to email your scorecard to your buddies and review actual stats for yourself are perks I didn't know I wanted, but now I can't live without!\n\nEnded up being cheaper to buy a new iPhone 3GS AND this app than the skycaddie I was looking at. Stand alone golf GPS units are in serious trouble.","50":"I have used this App for over 8 months, and is by far, the best golf GPS for the money. I had a sky caddie before, and it was not half as good as this app. Don't waste your money on any of the annual dues GPS units, buy this app and have everything you need. \n\nI have the iPhone 4, and only uses about half the battery during a 4 1\/2 to 5 1\/2 hour round. Turn off your Wi-fi if it is using more battery life than that. \n\nAnyway, must have for all serious golfers.","51":"Great app to keep track of hours. Especially if you're on salary or budgeting.","52":"This a great tool for a rapid lab consultation.","53":"I am a very superstitious person. I love any kind of ghost story. Short, Long, or a book. But this app has everything from short stories to long. Definitely worth the $$","54":"I'm ten and this stuff does not scare my and I'm  10 YEARS OLD!!!!","55":"Recently used in several European cities and it was GREAT!","56":"The best news, I always check Drudge first for the rest of the story!","57":"It's just getting better and better. The signature capture is a huge time saver. Ever wonder how to put your contact info from their email into your Contacts, just copy their signature into this app, it will separate into different fields and put them in your iPhone Contacts. How great!","58":"Someecards are super funny! They're a great way to give someone a good laugh. Sometimes I just like to look through them because they're fun to read.","59":"Great App for Travelers. Highly recommend it!","60":"A well engineered multipurpose calculator.  If the extensive template library doesn't have what you need you can easily create your own calculators without a steep learning curve. As a repeat customer since the Palm handheld days, I definitely consider this a great value.  Keep up the good work!","61":"This app has helped me control my phones battery usage.","62":"This is so cool. I love how many different frequencies there are to listen to.","63":"This app works wonders. \"Scans\" come out very clear and easy to send items. One of my most used apps!","64":"I use this app for completing my required expense report. Stores pics so you can return to them, pics are super clear. I'd only wish for a two per page option as the scans come back a full page. Overall, only $2. Hell of an app.","65":"Best replacement app if your laptop is broken!!","66":"This is a great educational app for students, especially the movies! It provides a great visual for abstract content.","67":"Since signing up I've lost 10 lbs in 2 weeks it's great","68":"Really like this app. It has been soo very helpful in tracking with everything instantly accessible. It really is amazing. Having previously worked in the weight loss industry for many years. I know that this is the key to planning and losing weight. I am doing well with both.","69":"Simple to use. Works flawlessly.  Loads of books to choose from.  I'm a fan.","70":"I've bee using EveryTrail.com for years - loving its ease and look for uploading my rides and embedding the maps on my blog. I used the free app for a long time, until recently on a trip I needed to find a trail and download it to use offline. Enter EveryTrail Pro. This app has practically replaced my GPS unit. I adjust the GPS settings to extend battery life and I can go on epic rides and still have power to text my buddies photos from the trail. I highly recommend it for on the fly trail mapping needs. Worth every penny.","71":"Helps so much with meal planning and grocery shopping.  Cuts time off of both those activities.","72":"A must have if you like to cook.  I think it is great!  Have tried a baked chicken wing recipe and was almost like deep fried.  I'm from Buffalo NY so I know.  Like being able to save Recipes in recipe box on the app. Get this app.","73":"Very useful. But it is difficult sometimes trying to type an essay without landscape mode. It is ridiculous how a word processing app doesnt let u type landscape.","74":"Well worth it. Great tool for review and on the spur of the moment reference.","75":"I actually believe this app is totally awesome in helping me prepare for my boards. However, just as the muscle name is given in audio; I wish there was an option hearing all the muscles info in audio. For me, retaining info comes better in audio, activities, and constant quizzing.","76":"I was very pleased with this app.  The graphics are excellent and the interface is very easy to use and navigate through.  The quiz options and video are a great bonus feature.  I am really satisfied (especially for the price) and look forward to trying out the other systems' software.  Nice Work!","77":"Excellent app, integrates well with Google Reader. A must-have app on all of my iDevices.","78":"Love app easy to use","79":"Very helpful in planning trip.","80":"I love this app because it gives you lots of great ideas for your home.","81":"A real lifesaver and eye opener for this iPad newbie.  I learned so much from this app.  Information is well written and easy to understand. Just wish my brain could retain it all for instant recall!","82":"Did not give 5 stars because have found not all campgrounds are listed.  Sure is helpful though 99.5% of time.  Have used for gas, reservations for camps, restaurant locations, low clearances.  Awesome!","83":"I was shocked to find the app includes overhead clearances and one can filter that down to what they are worried about.  Looks to be very thorough.  I have not yet tried it on the road but I am amazed at what I can find by sitting her in my house.  I am a little concerned about how much functionality I will find in remote locations with no cell service.  Time will tell.  I may have to update my rating when that situation arises which will be in 4 weeks.  Happy camping everyone!","84":"This application has been a lifesaver! It actually remotely sinks with both my IPhone and IPad . I love it!","85":"I love it now i can make people look fat and it is so easy","86":"Intuitive, limitless possibilities. Brings your artistic side out.","87":"I love checking in to see the weather forecasts! And it's such a beautiful perspective of our planet!!! It takes me outside of my usual \"local\" mentality.","88":"Its really fun and any age can play it and enjoy it! Will get you busy for a long time!","89":"Great app! Amazing features! Perfect for movie collectors. I love it!","90":"And the fact people are freaking about how real it is is why i give it a 5. It bases its replies off human replies so its very realistic but varies so much.","91":"I'm so impressed with this App! I tell everyone how it benefit & teaches everyday.","92":"Love this app because it helps me keep my finances in order. Easy to use!","93":"I have already submitted a review when I first downloaded stating That this App is the best. Well, yesterday it proved itself. I have a health condition and yesterday I had to go to the hospital. I just emailed myself my list, printed it and was able to give it to doctor. Even the Nurses and Doctors were impressed. \n\nThere is one thing, however, that I think would make this App even better. Add a COMMENT Area so you can write comments regarding yourself or the medications or whatever.","94":"Graphics are very nice. The game play is amazing, a lot of quick thinking. Plus you get to upgrade constantly. The one thing that bugs me is how short the game is and the way it repeats itself. That being said, I won't get tired of playing for a while.","95":"Awesome graphics","96":"Told me I was 31 when in 13 very sad app lowers self asteem lol don't get this app it is misleading and very inaccurate do not waste ur time","97":"Cooooool app ??????","98":"This app is a good time. Fun at parties.","99":"Outstanding!  You will enjoy listening to podcats on this app!","100":"If the stars could higher I would rate them as so. Want to be an orthopedic surgeon and this is the best app I've ever came across for learning the skeletal system!!! I would recommend it to anyone from a surgical trainee to a high school A&P student! The best, can't say it enough!","101":"A very fun and easy way to keep up with your heart rate...also quite accurate!!!","102":"This is a short Halloween story. There are several puzzles and a simple story showing Mickey who is later joined by friends. My 2 1\/2 year old will probably like it, but the 4 year old will be bored quickly. For one dollar this is ok.","103":"This app is a great tool to have for just about all types of foodies.","104":"I use skritter for learning Japanese and it's an application that requires flash, however I mainly study on my iPhone and probably wouldn't keep up with the SRS if I was only able to access the program on my computer. Thanks to splashtop, now I can practice on the go. (that sounds like a infomercial lol)","105":"Very nice !!!!!","106":"Very helpful in planning my day. Gives hour by hour estimated weather that is just as accurate as any other weather report. Love the graphics behind all of the information. It mostly follows the weather that is expected for the hour which adds a lot of visual interest.","107":"Weather app is awesome and very easy to use!","108":"This app is the best!!! The screensavers are so mesmerizing and makes you think you are looking right outside!! I love it!!!","109":"Beautiful display and lots of info instantly","110":"Good ,I like it. Is accurate . And high tech","111":"Continues to amaze . . . with information  and views of stellar objects.","112":"I love this app!  Easy to navigate and easy to post to!   One of my favorites!  :)","113":"Like the visuals of this app a lot, like how it updates weather as to where you are :)","114":"Without this its literally impossible to play music on my Xbox! Thanks! Happy birthday  ??","115":"Great way to keep up on your crossfit progress.","116":"Very nice radar app. Easy to use","117":"Lots of topics, something for everyone","118":"Works great! Maps are good, better than my Garmin. Default is the lowest cache amount so make sure you turn up the cache amount so you don't find yourself without any maps when you lose service. Make sure you scout your area with the maps you want before hunting so it will cache your map area for when you lose service you still can use your cached maps. Best 5 bucks spent for those who want a good hunting GPS.","119":"The new release shows what a mature iOS app should look like. It performs incredibly well, while offering most features (if not all) that users could want. Not only is it now offered at a lower price, but there is an option to enhance the application with an upgrade. Since few users need the enhancements, it is a great way to offer them.","120":"Love the app, use it all the time to check shipping activity in Puget Sound. Helpful whether on land or on the water.","121":"Really like this app. It is a very easy way to journal","122":"I have Day One on both my iOS devices, and my Mac. It just works beautifully, seamlessly, and smoothly.\n\nAdd simple photo function, and you'll rule the journal app world. \n\nFive star!","123":"I have been a P90X client for some time now and love the workout!  With the P90X app I now have the option of taking my workout to the gym or with me when I travel. Plus the nutrition journal makes it easier for me to keep track of what I eat during the day. For me it is a great app! Glad I purchased this app!","124":"I LOVE this game!!! Please add more options like a curler and much more stuff! I really want there to be a update!!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh and add MORE characters!!!","125":"Great app for viewing weather.","126":"It's as accurate as any weather forecaster who gets paid good money for often being 100% wrong. So far this app has been close enough to allow me to dress appropriately so who cares about too much scientific input. I just don't want to be carrying an umbrella when the sun is shining.","127":"Great little app to have on phone. Handy for those spur of the moment shopping sprees.  And easy to use to list items also.","128":"This is a great app. I've used ODB on my iPod Touch and then my iPhone before I got an iPad 2. Each version is more refined. I like the way that the app remembers my choice of Bible version (currently 'The Message') when I tap on the Scripture for the day. This isn't the case with the iPhone app. One always has to change the version from the default.\n\nThere are a couple formatting issue suggestions:\n\n1. The poem at the bottom of the page is almost never formatted like the online website. It would be nice if the lines were stacked and not simply strung out in a row.\n2. One of the things I've always enjoyed are the cover photos. The cover for the current month shows in the upper righthand corner, but there is no way to enlarge it. One would think that a simple double-tap could bring up the cover art full screen?\n3. When traveling I don't always have a wifi link, so having issues cached is nice. In those instances I simply use my Bible app (or print version) to get the Scripture for the day. I don't expect (or want) ODB to cache the Scripture from Biblegateway.com on my device, but it would be nice if there was a way in the app set-up to direct the ODB app to my Olivetree app onboard for the Scripture of the day. May be too difficult for what is already an elegant app.\n\nKeep up the good work!","129":"I have used this on countless occasions now. It has come in handy, and when I do use it the other party is as \"wowd\" as I was the first time. I gave 4 stars because the speech is a bit quirky (may be iPhone speech recognitions problems) and because it is a translator it breaks a sentence down funny. But, if you type or talk like a caveman it gets the point across every time. Overall very pleased with this for just a buck!","130":"I am truly amazed at how well this app works..the thing that stands out to me the most is the fact that when I am recording my voice for translation, IT ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS ME!! I have a very deep voice and I have never had any type of software that was able to take what I said and convert it to the correct version..I am very very very pleased with this app..you should get it ??","131":"I was looking for a good nightstand application and instead found a great app. Separate alarms, separate days, wake to music, slide dimmer. All around great app.","132":"I am a nursing student and this lab reference is the best I have ever seen or used! It has helped me understand the labs so much! I highly recommend the app!!!","133":"Very helpful for the home health nurse in the field.","134":"Clinilab Navigator, Lab Tests Online, Medline Plus, and WebMD for more information. Thousands of commonly used abbreviation","135":"Very practical, easy, and for all music lovers.","136":"I wanted an App that would separate my videos from my photo library.  I wanted to be able to play my photo slideshow without interruption from annoying videos.  The music stops and you have to start it over. Now the videos are on this app and I can play right through all my pictures.  Love it!","137":"Gives hourly weather for the day too!","138":"A must-have for students, or anyone who wants to improve their word power!","139":"It guesses is every time! Got all of one direction even Cher Lloyd! I love this app??????","140":"Great app for news on demand. No wasted screens to navigate through. Would give it 5th star if there was a button to close the app. Love NPR!","141":"Simple enough to use and I love the recurring transactions. No more forgetting and figuring out how to balance my checkbook every month. The other reason I got the app is because it can export to Quickbooks although I have not used that feature yet. The reports are great. Would love to be able to have main categories and sub-categories. That's the only thing missing in my opinion to make this a truly robust stand-alone financial management app. Keep up the good work!","142":"Best shoe app ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Correct dates and prices! Let's me know every thing about the shoe!??","143":"Excellent addition to the Angry Birds games. Great new features, challenges and visuals. If you are an Angry Birds fan, this is definitely worth it. The new \"orbit\" launching is very neat and a nice, innovative twist on the game. It's definitely harder... At least in my opinion, which is a good thing. Get it.","144":"Love it. Keeps me occupied while i have d time to wait","145":"This helps me keep track of all my budgets that I've set up (groceries, gas, rent, etc) and also has tons of graphs that compare my income vs expenses. Very easy to use and it's already helping me save my money.","146":"Love this app don't let me forget Birthdays.","147":"I never have to take a foreign language class again!!","148":"This app is great. Presents challenges for all ages. Quick yet stimulating. Only wish there was another level to play cuz its super addictive.","149":"Many options, easy to use, show it off on instagram and Facebook!","150":"I love this app. Its so easy to learn how to use it and its very easy to understand. The only thing I don't like is that if you choose the option to show what the temp feels like, you can't see what the temp actually is. I would love to be able to see both at the same time.","151":"I've used this app for three seasons! This is the first year that NFL owns it. I've drafted 8 teams over those years with this app! Very user friendly.","152":"We always use this app as we are always looking for great places to eat. We don't cook a lot so we look for variety in the places we try. This app never disappoints!","153":"This app is very helpful in my line of business.","154":"Lots of fun. Great learning tool.m","155":"Very easy to use !!!","156":"Very detailed gps even tracks laps at my local park","157":"Love this site it nails every question I have ever asked.very helpful and resourceful.once I found i could download this app for my phone it made it so much more convienant for us.my family goes by it and we love it!","158":"This app is so fantastic, I actually find it even better than the website. It is easy to navigate, easy to modify reservations. There is an option to add it to your calendar and it puts all the information right in your phone calendar. You can invite your co-diners easily through the app (it creates an email for you). A great part is that you can filter your search by 1000 point tables only, by neighborhoods within a city, by distance to you, and so much more. I use this app on a regular basis- so much that I'll make a reservation we just decided to go to so that it's easier when we get there! It's such a great app (and business) that I always wonder why some restaurants don't have it!","159":"Love this app, use it all the time!  Never a problem or any difficulties.","160":"Lots of measurements and long term forecasts.","161":"Mint is a great way to get control of your finances. It really helps you reign in your spending and makes you aware of what you spend your money on. I love the trending charts!","162":"Makes reading even more fun when you get rewards! Love the convenience of downloading a book and being able to read on my phone, iPad and computer. Extra bonus, it's free :)","163":"Syncing is a bit tricky at first, but otherwise wonderful. Reading interface is fab!","164":"Love this site.  So much info at your fingertips.  Watched a video on a procedure prior to surgery and it was comforting.  Thanks!","165":"As an author, I definitely nee something like this on the go. It's nice not having to wait until I get home to type the next chapter of my book, and I don't have to carry around my binder full of notebook paper. This is amazing ad extremely convenient!!","166":"U can read books and u don't even need wifi I luv it! U can also post books that u wrote your self","167":"A great app at hands reach. The pronunciation button is a useful tool when unsure of the proper pronunciation of a word. Also, multiple definitions are given to insure you are using the word in its true context.","168":"This app is great for road trips. The kids can listen to their music and I can put on headphones and listen to my books.","169":"I LOVE this app, super easy interface and I use it ALL the time.","170":"Great app.  No bugs.  Thoughtful, provoking news.","171":"Thanks for the thought & effort that went into creating this app.  Very handy for those of us that love the outdoors & natures transitions.","172":"I recently used this app during Hurricane Isaac. This app refreshed faster and was much more reliable than the other two with the big websites. Get it. You may need it when it counts. I did.","173":"Travel all d Eastern us and use this frequently to stay abreast of weather conditions","174":"Accurate and easy to use. I highly recommend it.","175":"I love this app! No more waiting for checks in the mail. I can take credit cards immediately. Good pricing too","176":"My favorite app. It really works! You must try it.","177":"Loved it","178":"Helps me relax and shake off stress","179":"I just blew $54 to sign up for three months of Weight Watchers because of this ap only to discover that this ap is not nearly as good as the free ap called \"Lose It!\" When my Weight Watchers membership expires, I will continue watching my food intake with Lose It!  Meanwhile, I am monitoring my progress using both aps so the transition will be seemless. So far, I'm finding that Lose It! is much faster and easier to use.","180":"Always get great comments about my photo editing!! Thanks so much!!!","181":"Great for uploading receipts on the go. Easier than reconciling on the computer.","182":"Very good!","183":"Love this app!  Very accurate. Quick response.","184":"Great way to save!  Thank u","185":"Who doesn't like a good deal every now & then? Usually something for everybody and easy user interface. Pretty thorough app","186":"super convenient and nice with new alerts!","187":"Love being able to work on my phone or laptop. My family tree is always up to date.","188":"Using for a few days now. Easy to navigate and understand. Love it.\nHope it stays free.","189":"Great app, huge selection of titles, and great free section with plenty of releases semi-monthly\/monthly. Only problem is the viewer occaisonally hangs up but not often and restarting the app usually remedies this. Overall, one of the best apps in the entire app store.","190":"Love this App!! Gives you locations and deals and everything you need!! Definitely amazing.","191":"LOVE IT.  From excursion with the kids to experiencing new eateries I've save a lot of money.  I try and take advantage of the huge savings on massages and good.  It's AWESOME!","192":"Helps with the hard to find SoNGs...\"","193":"This is one of my very FAVORITE apps. I tell everyone I know about it. If you are a music lover you'll love it. I really like that it even gives the lyrics to the song & shows other songs\/ music by the same musician(s). Our children love it too. It's great. Thank you","194":"Just great. I like Shazam too, but don't always want my friends to know the cheesy songs I'm looking up. I choose this one! :)","195":"Great UI that aggregates so much information into one place, great app! Super intuitive to use.","196":"This is one of my favorite apps! I was abandoned by my dad with a dead mom, and got caught stealing from a bread shop, got sent to Australia, learned to cook and sew, then married a builder. You NEED to get this app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","197":"Audiobooks and e books from the library this app is wonderful!","198":"This app works like a charm. Don't have to spend the extra time finding an available associate.","199":"It's like a mix of texting and talking, but better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","200":"Easy way to get in contact with people","201":"Love this saves me from having to turn on light using settings. I use it all the time.","202":"App works fine for basic bank accounts.","203":"The first and best app for parking rates at any place. What a life saver. The most useful app.","204":"It's good and easy to use.","205":"Couldn't be better really, with options to copy results and also send via text\/email..  would like to see an option for viewing results full-screen, sometimes the end gets cut off.. but it still copies\/pastes all of it so it's cool ;)","206":"EVERYONE FIRST OF ALL GET THIS APP IF U HAVE A FANTASY TEAM AND YES U CAN MAKE TRADES. GO TO STANDINGS CHOOSE THE TEAM U WANT TO TRADE WITH AND THEN PRESS PROPOSE TRADE AT TOP OF SCREEN!!!!!!","207":"I find this app very useful. It has mechanism and class info that most of the other free programs are missing. You can't do much better (esp for free)!","208":"Great app, always works and is spot on!","209":"Good to pass time","210":"Great and handy app. Love how you can listen to the pronunciation.","211":"I love that this app takes less than ten seconds to let you know where your battery life is!!!

Paperless, and I can study from my phone ANYWHERE!","213":"Great weather, eazy to understand.","214":"Very detailed","215":"This app made searching very easy, and quick. Get this app","216":"Great and useful app. I have nothing bad at all to say about it. It helps me find the best deals on gas around the city with little to no glitches. Does what it's supposed to. 5 stars!","217":"No matter where I travel, it's very accurate to use.","218":"Fort lauderdale. Il Lugano is making us feel like royalty!  Friendly, and bending over backward to relax us at the end of a long travel day.  Great app with great hotels!","219":"Particularly like the reminder!","220":"Accurate","221":"I absolutely love this app. I scan whatever I see....","222":"VERY easy to use, and I've found a ton of cool stuff getting into QR codes!! HIGHLY recommended","223":"Now that I have this app I can't imagine how I got anywhere without it. In my experience it's approx 98% accurate and the spoken directions are a necessity when you're driving alone. One improvement would be to have the spoken directions a little earlier especially on a busy highway. I'd recommend this app to anyone looking for reliable accurate directions.","224":"Somehow I lost my contacts. This app got everything back for me","225":"Finally. A secure place for my private photos. No more worrying about things being accidentally seen. Buy this.","226":"Absolutely handy for those pics you don't need everyone else to see.","227":"Great app especially for fantasy news. One of the great sources i use to get info first. Only thing is freezes for a min when you are scrolling on a article.","228":"Love this app, although I do wish you could add local stores to your store list","229":"Very beneficial app, enjoy looking and seeing what's available.","230":"Very surprised that is so much useful.","231":"3 days won't do. I need at least 5 days. Seems user friendly and easy to follow. Perhaps if it added the ingredients--not multiple entries for the some onion, per se.","232":"Decent app. Finally, notifications are here. Now please give us multi account login, Google.","233":"This is a great app for a family on a bujet","234":"In just 1 click I can search sales and plan out my trips. Love this !!!!","235":"Makes finding hard-to-find deals easy","236":"Great app. Great deals and great savings. What's not to like!?","237":"Super convenient. I love being able to order delicious food from my phone. Dominoes just keeps getting better and better!","238":"Bezt app ever.. And very convenient for local and international text","239":"This app was easy to use. I'm so glad I found it!","240":"great items. Fast, easy ordering. Love fab.","241":"Love that this app has \"real time\" temp reading on the home screen, so there is no need to open app entirely to view the current temp!","242":"I am able to find most of the music I like and I can play anywhere I go...","243":"Every time I try to go on this app it crashes and sends me back the my home page. I have to keep trying and trying to get on. Other than the crashing this is a great app, and I'll give it 5 stars once the crashing problem is fixed.","244":"Great app! Works great with my playlists! Wish it worked with Pandora! Definitely not worth paying for the pay version of C25k because this up to date.","245":"Very good.  Your forecast are always current and accurate!","246":"Harder than I thought it would be, fun, and neat.","247":"There's so many cool selections??","248":"I love this app c: now I can take a pic of myself without having to hold it like always -.- <3","249":"Works perfect and picks up a ton of stations that are really far.","250":"Has a lot of workouts for being a free app","251":"I love variety of monster to fight,and love the effect of the parking falling down using as a ramp! Good Game!!","252":"Fun way to get back in touch with classmates in a time-capsule way!","253":"Outstanding! Everything u need for ideas in one place. A lot quicker then searching the web, good job fellas!","254":"Great pictures","255":"It has some really cool and interesting tattoos","256":"Good way to get an idea for a tat!!:)","257":"It's great for my brother because he's only four so when Disney comes on I can play this for him so he's not bord.","258":"Love this app. You decide how you want your collage.
