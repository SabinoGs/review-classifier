Crozier","helpful":[3,4],"reviewText":"As others have said in their review, the Rhapsody service is very nice.  It has a great catalog, and on the iPhone and PC, the applications are great.The Android version, on the other hand, is a complete disaster.  I had high hopes for this app, since my main complaint with the iPhone version was AT\u0026T;'s spotty 3G coverage (even in metro areas).  Switching to the Droid and Verizon at least took care of the service coverage.So what's wrong with Rhapsody on the Android?  With a music service with 11 million+ songs, it's natural to build up your collection a bit.  You do this in Android by adding songs to your \"library\".  However, with 150 artists, the Android app takes over 5 minutes to load the library.  If you are looking for an artist at the beginning of the alphabet, not a problem.  If you are looking for ZZ Top, you have to scroll through your library and watch \"Loading...\" pop up over and over and over (ever 20 artists) until several minutes later (or more on 3G) you get the full set loaded.If this were a one time event, maybe it wouldn't be so bad.  But Rhapsody commits the unpardonable sin of mobile app development -- It doesn't cache the library locally.  Every time you play a song and come back to the library, you go through the same 5 minute teeth-gnashing exercise.  Incredible ....There are potential other ways to access your music.  You can use playlists, or you can search for each song you want to play.  Unfortunately you still have to search the entire 11M+ song library, since there is no local search until the full library is loaded (several minutes later).  Regardless, if you want to manage your music library as, well, a music library, the Rhapsody Android app falls over.Potential alternatives are RDIO, which while not perfect, does cache your library (called \"collection\" in that app) locally.  Or Grooveshark, which doesn't have a collection at all (but for all intents and purposes, neither does Rhapsody on the Android).","overall":2.0,"summary":"Falls over if you have more than a few songs","unixReviewTime":1306108800,"reviewTime":"05 23, 2011","_etag":"09816aa048aae8036cee985aa8b792418e8f1d6e","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-01T13:46:53.000Z"},"requirement_type":"non-functional requirement"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fbcdfa02974cb647297"},"reviewerID":"A24B08OMSNN4JV","asin":"B004AFQAUA","reviewerName":"Slomo","helpful":[0,1],"reviewText":"only issue is new music doesnt always show up tuesday mornings. it will show either tuesday afternoon or sometimes not till wedbesday.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Great app","unixReviewTime":1313107200,"reviewTime":"08 12, 2011","_etag":"3bbe5a1d67be7086c67d4b35b365cc51cede1c6a","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-01T13:47:01.000Z"},"requirement_type":"functional requirement"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fbcdfa02974cb647289"},"reviewerID":"AVLQVEEF5GYO9","asin":"B004AFQAUA","reviewerName":"rosemary wehbe","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"GREAT MUSIC.

While Spotify revolves heavily around playlists and radio, Rhapsody has both and a whole lot more. It is much easier to navigate and find the music you are looking for and it includes easy access to your saved music library. Plus you can download individual tracks, albums, and playlists for offline play. Both the interface and visual appearance are very nice. The sound quality tops out at 192 kbps AAC+, which is not as high as some services, but sounds great from my experience. There is a lower setting if you need to save data usage. Any song in their library can be listened to on-demand (or as part of a playlist or radio station) through their app. All ad-free.The service itself requires a subscription, currently $10 per month. While they do have free trials, they do not currently have a free version of the service. So if you are not interested in subscribing or giving it a trial run, then this app is probably not for you.I use this app on my first generation Kindle Fire and so far no complaints.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Great Music App","unixReviewTime":1387411200,"reviewTime":"12 19, 2013","_etag":"0b56c32b297a54b46d124a72a9b069307aed58ca","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-01T13:52:35.000Z"},"requirement_type":"non-functional requirement"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fbcdfa02974cb64724c"},"reviewerID":"A1VU2GJ69T1C7R","asin":"B004AFQAUA","reviewerName":"Kevin Smith","helpful":[0,1],"reviewText":"For those of you that do not want to pay per song and have access to an MP3 player (and you don't mind plugging it in every month), this service is for you.

I love being able to use the service with a REAL mp3 player, not just an android phone or ipod touch/iphone.  With the desktop app, the service works with Sandisk MP3 Players (Most are supported but check rhapsody before you purchase one)Now for this app.  The app on android and Kindle is great.  It gives you access, not just to their radio feature, but also to their \"all you can eat\" music service.  You can download the tracks to your phone for free (As long as you keep paying the monthly fee, these songs stay active\".  Their \"radio\" feature is great if you like services like Pandora.  The Rhapsody radio doesn't have the ads like Pandora and other free radio services.  The radio feature is also very smart just like Pandora (Though I would say it is not as smart as Pandora).Overall this is a great app if you like music and like being able to choose what songs you want to listen to or if you wanna listen to an entire album!!

But Rhapsody front ends on the Droid and the PC are sub-par.  The latest app update is better than the previous, but its still butt-ugly, and getting around feels harder than it needs to be.  They've added hi-def streaming to the latest version, and it sounds great.  A track still occassionaly drops, but I'm getting fewer of them now.Someone said that you need a higher priced subscription to use the PC software.  This isn't true, my 9.99/month subscription allows me to use the software on one mobile device and 3 PC's.But as far as the PC software goes, its simply awful.  Its supposed to handle downloads and transfers to your mobile device for offline listening, but I can't get it to work properly with my phone.  Its also hideously ugly (think old school Itunes).  Windows doesn't look like apple, so don't make an app that poorly emulates the look of an app that's already ugly.Great service...just wish they'd write better software, and hire someone who wasn't colorblind to build the interfaces.  Black and blue and gray...no real polish.Easy 5-stars if they bring their interfaces into the modern age, and make the PC version work right.  I've figured out how to download stuff to my phone for offline listening without the PC client, but a functioning client would make this so much more pleasant.They've released a web beta that looks pretty darn sharp--hoping they'll bring its look and feel down to the PC and Android soon and move the button/menu options around so I have less mis-taps.","overall":3.0,"summary":"If only...","unixReviewTime":1308700800,"reviewTime":"06 22, 2011","_etag":"8613777c21026b2dadeb722f8bf04d3ddc753f55","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-05T01:51:20.000Z"},"requirement_type":"non-functional requirement"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fbcdfa02974cb6472b1"},"reviewerID":"A3QRHPPU8W1UAY","asin":"B004AFQAUA","reviewerName":"Veronica2001","helpful":[1,2],"reviewText":"Sigh...I depend on Rhapsody to get me through the day and now I believe that's past!

Cons: songs did lots of skipping/jumping, even when I had 4 bars \u0026 4G, and even online (though songs sometimes continued when coverage was bad); lacks the customization of thumbs up/down that I grew used to in Pandora; playlist UI isn't helpful - it shows a big view of the album of the currently playing song, then the list rolls of the screen, with no view of the upcoming song (you have to scroll all the way down the list); no lockscreen control; online there doesn't appear to be a way to create shortcuts to favorite radio stations; no scrobbling (there are some 3d party programs for online use).

Pandora, a free service seems to have better audio quality.I originally signed up for the Pandora Service a couple of weeks ago to serve up some music at a Party we were throwing.  Seemed like a great option, since I could stream all 35 tracks of the Music I wanted. Utilizing my WiFi Hotspot, I was able to play through the list with no problems.  Only problem was that if I wanted to play a song \"out of order\" of the playlist, there was no way to dynamically do this.So today, a couple of weeks later, my wife wants to listen to the Kindle Fire in the car (we have it hooked up to car Stereo), and when I first started up the app, it asked for my username and password.  I entered it and it said that the account wasn't found.  I then went to the website to try to log into my account (I'm thinking OK, maybe my Credit Card was declined or something, let me use another one.... ) and the website says the same thing.  Now I'm thinking, OK, maybe I forgot the password.  So I click to reset my password, and it says \"Error Processing Request\".  Half hour later, I try again to reset my password, and finally it allows me to reset the password.  Once I did, I can finally access my account again.Maybe there was an outage and maybe they were updating the site, but either way we should get some sort of notification of what's going on.  I have 3 days left on my trial membership and I will keep it going, only because they saved me a ton of money on that party.  However, if I keep having these kinds of issues, I WILL just cancel.","overall":3.0,"summary":"Stopped working - Can't access my account???","unixReviewTime":1368921600,"reviewTime":"05 19, 2013","_etag":"5c5a2d4d2a9280586aa23fe050496428d8cd4ab3","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-05T01:59:46.000Z"},"requirement_type":"functional requirement"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fbcdfa02974cb647267"},"reviewerID":"A8LP85E07KID4","asin":"B004AFQAUA","reviewerName":"mstephens","helpful":[1,4],"reviewText":"this app is stupid!it clames the tis free but  you have to have a credit card to singh up! thats why i like pandora. all you need is an email.","overall":1.0,"summary":"this is stupid!","unixReviewTime":1351382400,"reviewTime":"10 28, 2012","_etag":"637acab503137b4e4f9151fc70bf1868e089f7d8","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-05T12:14:25.000Z"},"requirement_type":"functional requirement"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fbcdfa02974cb64725f"},"reviewerID":"A1K6QL4P5X7P05","asin":"B004AFQAUA","reviewerName":"Michael L.

I found the app itself to be flawless. The interface is quick and responsive. Downloading music is effortless and sounds really good (make sure you select high-quality streaming and downloads in settings). In order to use their service, you must sign-up for a subscription. It is difficult to find exactly what you're getting for $9.99/month. Don't let \"Unrestricted access\" trick you into thinking you can access your music anytime anywhere. You can only authorize 1 portable device and up to 3 computers. For me this means I can either authorize my Kindle Fire HD or my Android Phone, but not both. The number of tracks they claim to have in their catalog ranges from 13 to 18 million. Electronic and trance music fans might find their catalog to be disappointing. Their Cloud Sync service was only able to match 57 percent titles in my library. Your mileage may vary depending on type of music you listen to.

First, it\u0026#8217;s impossible to find a phone number to talk with a customer service representative, which is a fundamental aspect of basic/decent customer service.Second, since I began my subscription about four years ago, I\u0026#8217;ve had two instances where the service stopped working through my surround sound system because of updates that Rhapsody made to its system.  In both cases, there were no or inadequate advance communications with subscribers, so the burden has been on us as customers to muddle through resolution.Both cases have involved firmware updates to subscribers\u0026#8217; receivers which not everyone knows how to do.  Rhapsody doesn\u0026#8217;t help at all but instead sends customers on a \u0026#34;goose chase,\u0026#8221; instructing us to contact the manufacturers\u0026#8217; of our receivers.  Good customer service would consist of Rhapsody coordinating with the manufacturers in advance of the firmware updates to make the process easier for customers.For the first update, I eventually had to pay my A/V professional to come to my house and get it done which took him about two hours; he had to do likewise for a number of his customers.I still have to make the second firmware update (as a result of Rhapsody system changes in late 2013) and Rhapsody is telling me that if, after the update, the service still doesn\u0026#8217;t work, then my Denon receiver -- which is less than four years old -- is now incompatible with Rhapsody.Bottom-line: Rhapsody\u0026#8217;s lack of basic customer service and hassles such as having to make repeated firmware updates likely will run me off and I probably will switch to another music service.","overall":1.0,"summary":"Atrocious customer service","unixReviewTime":1389139200,"reviewTime":"01 8, 2014","_etag":"446e31ad92aa3883a61f1ddab9c4f06b23289741","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-06T13:46:10.000Z"},"requirement_type":"functional requirement"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fbcdfa02974cb6472b4"},"reviewerID":"AMNRMCC3IHXSD","asin":"B004AGCR1K","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Does not work in B\u0026W;, image comes out in high contrastcolor mode works better, but it does not focus the camera so the document is blurry","overall":1.0,"summary":"Poor Application","unixReviewTime":1301443200,"reviewTime":"03 30, 2011","_etag":"cb7bd81e319f3678a7d609de5e679f60ecb4eeda","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-06T13:46:20.000Z"},"requirement_type":"functional requirement"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fbcdfa02974cb6472b9"},"reviewerID":"ANC9JP829KCI","asin":"B004AHBBPW","reviewerName":"A.

It is a simple tower defense game and from that point of view it did what it said it would. It featured 13 different maps and it had a fast forward button to play through each attack at high speed. As long as you plant enough power towers to let your weapons fire you will have it made. You can gain enough points to update the weapons and vastly improve their power for killing the bubbles. The flying balloon weapons are nice as they can track the invaders along the route and continuously bring lethal fire down upon the bubbles. We all know air power rules the battle.I liked how the game did not ask for multiple permissions and finally someone listened to the users and stopped all of the intrusive requests.That being said I have to admit I am not much into tower defense games like this one.

I play it everyday, multiple times a day. Like others who have it a 1 star review I also like Jelly Defense and Plants vs Zombies; while the graphics may not be as good as those other games, I'm getting much more play time out of this. Jelly Defense took me a while to finish and was worth it (if I had paid for it, another Free App of Day), this one is taking me much much longer to finish.  I'd rather the graphics be lacking if the game can be played for many weeks, or more?I'm addicted to it. I just wish I knew a little more about how certain things work, I'm trying to figure these out. Like I recently learned upgrading the power stations is very important, not just buying more. Upgrade everything.Sometimes I notice a tower right next to a power station let all the things go by without shooting at any of them, I'd like to know what I'm doing wrong when that happens, but that's rare. Also I want to know what it means when a tower has that little power graphic flash or sometimes just stay solid. Does it mean it needs power? Like it wants to shoot but can't at the moment?So other than a wanting a few more instructions, I love the game. Even with the things I can't seem to figure out, it still gets 5 stars.I'm surprised by all the low ratings here and wonder if it's mostly people who dont like or know how to play defense games.I wish people would realize they should rate on the quality of the app, not on whether it's their type of app. The low ratings hurt the developer and cause them to sell less games.If you like defense games get it, if I was suddenly forced to pay for it now, I would definitely buy it, because after a few weeks of playing I have lots of play-time left. Actually, I think I'll end up moving on to a new game before ever finishing all these levels.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Love it","unixReviewTime":1334361600,"reviewTime":"04 14, 2012","_etag":"ca5ecfd8c419cd9b3e3d77ece925e1fbedd5743f","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-07T22:39:04.000Z"},"requirement_type":"non-functional requirement"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fbcdfa02974cb647359"},"reviewerID":"A7D1SPQ5FPVH3","asin":"B004AHBBPW","reviewerName":"Ivan","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"This is a very inspirational app. I am just returning to the word after a long time without its guidance.

In my opinion - it could use better descriptions of the towers in the help menu. It's never mentioned that you NEED a power station - or your towers just shoot once...  I think the icon on a tower once it's depleted it's power does a decent job, but that kind of information is critical to gameplay and should be clearly spelled out in the instructions somewhere.I initially went to the help menu because I tried to DRAG my tower to where I wanted to.  It moved amazingly slow.  I figured that COULDN'T be how it was supposed to be.  It wasn't.  The help screen let me know to touch the location where I wanted the tower and then drag it for fine tuning (which actually works well).\"ESC to cancel\" also isn't of much help on the single button kindle fire.  To cancel placing a tower on the kindle fire, hit the little arrow at the bottom of the screen that brings up your menu, then hit the \"back\" arrow.Something else I would REALLY like to see is a \"restart level\" option.  I've placed my towers wrong and I want to go back and do it all again.  I have to exit and save - go back to the main menu, choose the level, select to start fresh.  It would be a lot easier to have menu options to just start over.I like the fact that this game doesn't have crazy permission requirements - but I don't think it's a $2.99 game.","overall":3.0,"summary":"Not the best...","unixReviewTime":1331424000,"reviewTime":"03 11, 2012","_etag":"687954b6788018e73854bee9b997b260bdad6fc3","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-06T14:09:36.000Z"},"requirement_type":"non-functional requirement"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fbcdfa02974cb647339"},"reviewerID":"A2BD12CY0NO0C4","asin":"B004AHBBPW","reviewerName":"Emmaleigh \"eeyorefive\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"So far this it the best Daily Bible that I've found as a free app so far.

This app doesn't offer much - it is a clunky game that lacks finesse, especially in level and unit design.The most frustrating part is that the towers are slow. They fire a single shot, and then take forever to reload. And thats plenty of time for a herd of bubbles to go whizzing by. Not much of a defense. It takes a while to figure out that you need to build and upgrade power stations to recharge your towers so they can fire more than once. The instructions aren't too helpful, either. The touchscreen is also laggy at times, which adds to the frustration.It might be easier to just include a button that lets you wave a white flag and surrender, rather than wait patiently for inevitable annihilation.There are many better TD games out there.

The initial towers you can purchase shoot once.  As you earn more coins you can upgrade to better towers, power stations etc.  Anyways, the game looks simple in appearance, but again it's just a simple TD game for your phone.  The two things i don't like were the instructions didn't mention that you can upgrade during waves, not just between waves.  Also, I couldn't slide towers across my screen.  I could only move them by touching the spot on my screen where i'd want them.  This was tedious at times because the tip of your finger isn't as accurate as if you were using a stylus.

However, why this developer keeps cranking out game apps that can't be moved to the external SD card remains a mystery and a concern. Yes, it's only a MB in size, and I can fit this app and a whole team of Clydesdale horses in my phone's internals, but for some folks, this will become an issue during app \"spring cleaning,\" and apps like this will be the first to go.Second, wish I would have known the app has no sounds so I didn't have to spend time fiddling with phone settings, thinking it was my settings.Third, with all the same complaints about the power stations over at Google Market, you would think the developers would rethink the app and take them out.  They don't HAVE to -- it's THEIR game.  But if they want to make it OUR game on our devices and charge for it, they would be wise to just redesign it and give the people what they're begging for!  They should take the complaints about the towers for what they really are:  FREE development strategy advice being handed to them on a silver platter!Fourth, the gameplay.  Sadly, it is indeed laggy as many have reported, and coupled with the frustration of the towers, it's just not providing any fun.  If the towers are necessary to provide the energy, they shouldn't be so expensive.  I'm just not sure lowering their price is going to satisfy those who already have developed a distaste for their existence to begin with and, hence, not be the solution to end the complaints.Maribou may want to to take this app back to the drawing board and make these changes... or not.  Depends on whether they want to stay competitive in at least the tower defense market.  And if their ultimate goal is to have customers download multiple apps they create, then for heaven's sake -- let them go to the SD card to attract some non-rooted customers and those who are vigilant as to what they feel is necessary and important enough to take up precious phone space.","overall":1.0,"summary":"A swing and a miss......","unixReviewTime":1331424000,"reviewTime":"03 11, 2012","_etag":"d796e7c0493d775bee3911aa1de5bf3a0cace9cf","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-06T14:44:01.000Z"},"requirement_type":"non-functional requirement"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fbcdfa02974cb647336"},"reviewerID":"AA8VU9L49VZK2","asin":"B004AHBBPW","reviewerName":"eileen mack \"leen\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"We use this for our daily reading.

Quite brilliant, that; it solves the problem of trying to carefully place the tower while it's under your thumb.Enemies come from left to right on the first level.

For those of you who can't read or have no common sense: the first little icon shoots one bullet at a time at incoming enemies.  Next icon, (ship wheel looking thing,) shoots out in all directions. Fire icon melts ice balls that will eventually come, or shoots one bullet at regular ones. Blue spiral thing...can't remember. Hot air balloon follows enemies \u0026amp; shoots at them. Finally, the red power icon sets up a power station.While this game may not be goty material, nor is it amazing graphics-wise (they aren't bad, just simple) it's still a good tower defense game.

Especially in huge lots like at sports stadiums or concert venues. One place in particular I frequent is an outdoor amphitheater where there are many lots, widely scattered in fields over dozens of acres surrounding the pavilion. So, I downloaded this app and began testing it out. I must say, I'm impressed by the layout, ease of use and many thoughtful features included. I especially like the feature that allows you to text-message the car's location to others in your group. At concerts or sporting events this is a nice feature to have if people get separated from the main group. Of course, this app is not just useful for finding cars - it can be used to remember any given location - say, your hotel when you're traveling in a large, unfamiliar city. I realize Google Maps can handle much of the same functionality but it's nice to have a dedicated app devoted to just one purpose.I've tested this app out and found it to be precise, accurate (to within 9 feet!) and easy to use. The user interface is simple, attractive and logically laid out. Pop-up tips explain everything the app is doing, and provides advice if you need it. It invokes Google Maps for street directions if you wish, and even allows you to take a picture of the surrounding area where the car is parked in order to help you get a better mental fix on your car's location when you're getting close.The built-in timer is a handy way of knowing when it's time to put more quarters in the parking meter. You can set the app to throw a notification when your car has been parked for the length of time that you choose. Tip: If you use this to time parking meters, it might be a good idea to set that timer for a few minutes less than the timer on the parking meter. that gives you enough time to walk back to the meter and feed it more coins. Who knows, it might save you from getting a parking ticket!There are a number of permissions involved with using this app, but they all square with the intended functions of the app, so I don't understand why so many people here are so leery of what permissions are needed.In summary, there is simply no excuse for not being able to find your vehicle if you have this nicely-designed app. This is much better than just using Google Maps, in my opinion.","overall":5.0,"summary":"A Most Helpful App","unixReviewTime":1312070400,"reviewTime":"07 31, 2011","_etag":"dbc85037892817260cdf506527b564b92802077b","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-12T11:56:30.000Z"},"requirement_type":"other"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fbcdfa02974cb647510"},"reviewerID":"A2IDJABRZX4LPT","asin":"B004AMDC86","reviewerName":"Chris","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"This game is amazing if you love cryptograms.

Car locator *might* be for you.  It's pretty simple to use, and has a ton of extra features tossed in.  Simply tap the little guy in the corner and close the app.  Wen you open it again, it will show you which way you need to go to get back to your car.  Use it to take a pic of your spot and or the cars near you, just in case you need a little extra help or your car is damaged while you're away.  A lot of thought and effort went into Car Locator, and it's a handy little tool.  While obviously it's gear toward automotive use, realistically you can use it to find your way back to any spot you mark.The unhappy truth about this app though is that it relies on GPS location and a digital compass to lead you back.  While you can get away without having the digital compass, you're out of luck without GPS.  This can include times where you're in a spot where GPS signal is weak or non-existent, like a parking garage or around very tall structures.  How accurate Car Locator is is heavily dependent on how good a GPS and GPS signal you have, both at the time you mark your location and when you start trying to find your way back. In my testing, Car Locator was off by as much as 50 feet at times, which may not sound like much, but it's enough to put a good number of cars between you and where you want to be.Overall, I think it's a pretty cool app that will do what it claims if conditions are right.","overall":4.0,"summary":"Pretty decent and for more than just cars","unixReviewTime":1312070400,"reviewTime":"07 31, 2011","_etag":"a6ae7b07c2b6ed5e4ac45902db315d5dd1e62b17","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-10T13:33:58.000Z"},"requirement_type":"other"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fcbdfa02974cb647574"},"reviewerID":"AEJM5XH00Y57C","asin":"B004ANC00Q","reviewerName":"K.

This app found them all when I provided my zip code.  It permits easy 'filtering' to delete those that are of no interest.  After deleting ones of no interest, it lists all the remaining (in my case 23) in increasing numerical order.  For each channel in this window it gives three listings, what's currently on, and the next two listings.  What I found wonderfully valuable, when a channel from this list is clicked-on, it opens another window that shows all the listings for that one channel for the rest of the day, and even into the next day, along with a detail description of each listing.  It also allows one to scroll back in time to see what was on earlier, so one can see if a desired show has been missed.My Samsung 46\" HDTV has a nice TV listing capability, but this 'TV' app is even better.A few additional comments (room for improvement):- when in the detailed listings window for one channel, clicking on the back arrow on the Kindle-Fire returns one to the 'main' TV window.- the search feature, which is accessed via the magnifying glass icon on the Kindle Fire menu bar, only searches current programs.- there is no 'help' or instruction page, but except for a few items like the above, most are self-event.02/08/14 UPDATE:Since the `upgrade' of the `TV Listing' app in December 2013 the channel filtering capability has become unreliable, making this app far less user friendly than it was prior.  As such I've downgraded my rating to 3 stars.While many channels can be successfully filtered-out (in my case 120), they typically reappear after one or two additional uses of the app; that is, exiting the app and returning to it at a later time.I've come to learn that the created filter is not lost, but is simply not being applied.  A total reboot of my Kindle Fire tablet does, in fact, result in the filter being applied without having to recreate it.  However, rebooting the KF is time-consuming, and otherwise of no value (The KF sleeps beautifully with no noticeable battery drain, and it wakes from sleep much, much faster than the time it takes to reboot it.)We user's will of course be very grateful when the channel filtering capability is returned to its former reliability.The TV app is otherwise a great app.  When, and if, the channel filtering is returned to its prior functionality I will again update this review and upgrade my star rating.04/27/14 UPDATE:As of the April 2014 upgrade of `TV Listing', the channel filtering capability now works perfectly.  Along with other improvements such as the capability to separately list movies, sports, documentaries, etc. for not only the current day, but also for any day in the following week, this app is outstanding.  It now also has a search capability to find a specific desired showing, as well the ability to set an Alert in advance of a desired presentation (my Kindle Fire gives off a loud buzz).  This app now easily deserves a full 5 star rating, and then some!","overall":3.0,"summary":"Used to be an absolutely terrific App","unixReviewTime":1371945600,"reviewTime":"06 23, 2013","_etag":"e6aff71ddcb4b379ca1449412f27cd5601356447","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-12T12:20:38.000Z"},"requirement_type":"other"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fcbdfa02974cb6475ce"},"reviewerID":"A2ASS8BDJJUFKP","asin":"B004ANMWPY","reviewerName":"A.

You can configure your TV provider and select the channels that you want to see.  The only real issue I've had ongoing is that it occasionally adds additional channels that I am not interested in and I have to remove them, but I can do this from the main screen, so it isn't a big deal.Recently (the past couple of months), however, it keeps losing the configuration info.  It still knows my provider, but the channels I am not interested are no longer excluded.  There are over 700 channels with my TV provider and while most that I am interested in are at the beginning of the list, there are some that are not and it is a pain to scroll to find them.  It takes a couple of minutes to reconfigure.  There are options in the configuration screen for \u0026#34;select all\u0026#34; and \u0026#34;deselect all\u0026#34;, which is great because with so many channels, I can deselect and then simply select the ones I want, but the fact that I recently have to keep doing this is a deal-breaker.I waited to post such a review because I wanted to give the developer a chance to correct, but apparently they are either unaware of the problem or uninterested in fixing it.

Previously, I opened up my computer and went to the TV Guide website.  But that was more of a hassle than I wanted, and I seldom used it.  I decided to check out what free apps were available for my phone, since it is usually sitting next to me when I watch TV.This app was one of the highest rated, so I decided to try it.  Great program!  It's very simple and easy to use.  There are features I wish it had (like setting up a repeated reminder, rather than having to set a reminder for each time a show comes on), and the search feature didn't turn up things it should have, but the brilliance of the program is just that you can so easily and quickly be using it.

The best feature of this app is speed, but the navigation could be better - see below for more details.PROS: The interface is simple and uncluttered, and it's very fast. Setup is pretty intuitive. You can set reminders within the program, or use the Share with Friends feature to send it to your notes or reminders apps (which it detects automatically). The Share option also detects email and messaging apps, not just social media accounts (I don't have any set up, so I don't know whether it detects those, but the auto-detect seems strong, so I imagine it does. But it won't prompt you to log in to social media accounts you don't have or want like many apps do).CONS: Rather than a grid, it shows the next 3 shows for the selected time in list view for each channel, which is not ideal for planning an evening of viewing. The link to change the time is tiny, and hard to open without tapping the channel below it instead. Scrolling is oversensitive, so it's tough to get it to a specific channel without going past it. A giant ad fills the second screen as you scroll down, which makes it especially difficult to scroll to the channels right above and below the ad (which happen to be the ones I watch most). You can set favorite channels, but after it's been running in the background for awhile, it forgets them. There is no favorites button to bring them back, and refreshing doesn't help. You have to go back to your home screen and reclick the icon, sometimes 2-3 times to get it to show your favorites again. The reminder times are preset, with no custom option (so it will remind 5 or 15 minutes before program, but not 10). This is a minor issue, with an easy workaround, however - as mentioned in Pros, it auto-detects your reminder and notes apps through the Share with a Friend function, so you can swiftly export to another app with customizable time settings.CONCLUSION: All-in-all, this app is just OK, although it is faster and simpler than most. A few navigation tweaks (larger and better separated time changing button, smaller ads, slower scroll) and fixing the favorites caching problem could build on that to give it a major leg up over the crowd, but as it is now, I'm ready to jump ship if I find anything better.","overall":3.0,"summary":"Basic","unixReviewTime":1393632000,"reviewTime":"03 1, 2014","_etag":"2ad416ea38d9c5e95491b3300daff47cb9488bc4","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-15T12:59:14.000Z"},"requirement_type":"non-functional requirement"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd1dfa02974cb64772d"},"reviewerID":"A3N515IBSLQ6HJ","asin":"B004ANMWPY","reviewerName":"Kyle Ballard","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"Good app for good price but wished it had Honeycomb support or at least scaled instead of just being a tiny box.

However, the newest versions of TV Guide leave a lot to be desired, in my opinion.Along comes this App which I stumbled across purely by accident...but it's absolutely stellar.It's like having a virtual TV Guide on my tablet and my phone.  I especially like that I can filter out channels that I'm not interested in.  I have filtered out all of the shopping networks and several of the news networks, along with all of the country music channels and ALL of the \"Music playing on a blank screen\" channels.The search feature works great, and the other major feature that I truly love is the fact that you can quickly select \"Movies, Sports, or What's On\" right from the main menu.

You can also delete the channels that you have no interest in (my list of deleted was SPORTS, which makes up about 1/3 of our channel line up), PLUS you can drill down to the actual programming for the title that's showing to see if you have already watched that particular episode, and go ahead in time to see what's coming up.DEFINITELY a frustration saver!!!!!!!","overall":5.0,"summary":"NO SCROLLING!!!!!","unixReviewTime":1376784000,"reviewTime":"08 18, 2013","_etag":"0c6fd70f8d1bbcabd46f9530956a704257c17d39","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-13T20:29:12.000Z"},"requirement_type":"other"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd1dfa02974cb64771f"},"reviewerID":"AVPBMRZDNEHJ4","asin":"B004ANMWPY","reviewerName":"Kevin McPherson","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"The app is a snap to configure and has accurate listings for the criteria defined.

The only shortcomings that I have found are related to the screen size of an Android device, and the number of channels that a TV provider carries.  For the latter, if your provider carries hundreds of channels that you do not watch, you have to go through the channel list and delete those of no interest.  This can take quite a bit of time.  The screen size of most Android devices is relatively small, limiting the amount of information that can be viewed at one time.

Sometimes works, sometimes won't connect to my network. Also the previous version allowed you see TV schedules several days into the future; I can't find how to do that now and the channel filtering is more laborious. I'm giving 3 stars because when it works it's okay but as it is it's way too undependable in this new iteration. If all the kinks are worked out I'll edit this review. However, since the old version worked so well why can't they just 'downgrade' back to it (or 'upgrade' back to the old version)?To top it all off I tried the 'Contact Us' button. It asked for my email address as was expected. What was not expected was asking for my email password - wtf!!! To say the least I aborted my attempt at contact. Seemed like an attempt at phishing or ID theft to me.4-7-14 UPDATE: I found the feature that allows you to see future schedules but only for one particular channel at a time. In order to see future schedules you must tap on each individual channel. Again, cumbersome and laborious. Also when I opened the program today I found all OTA channels listed - not filtered for my channels. Oh boy, how long is it going to take to get it right??!!!

TV Listings by Jersey completely drained my battery.I was so disappointed with TV Listings that I compared it to TV Guide.  In fairness, this isn't in-depth; there may be non-intuitive ways to do things I couldn't quickly find.Configuration:TV Listings takes longer than TV Guide to start-up.TV Listings and TV Guide both have providers.  Neither has packages, so if you have, e.g., Dish HD with ~150 channels, you still have 1200+ listedYou can reduce those visible by setting \"Favorites\" in TV Guide or \"Filter\" in TV Listings.  This is easier in TV Listings; they're on one screen with checkboxes, like the Dish Network \"Favorites\" screen.  In TV Guide, it seems you have to click on each channel from the listing page and then add it to your Favorites, which is much much slower.Search:TV Listings has a terrible search.  It's slow but works, but only shows results for the current-grid half-hour.  So if you search for \"Charmed\" (which is in heavy rotation these days), you don't get ANY displayed results if it isn't on NOW.  You can hit \"+\" or \"-\" to switch time slots, but that takes another 25 seconds and you have to repeat and repeat and repeat to find if it's showing today.  So if you want to find out when \"Training Your Dragon\" is playing, you're out of luck.TV Guide search works as you would expect.  Results are listed by day, all retrieved at once, and easy to scroll through.  And you can organize by Date, alphabetically by Title (though since you still have to expand the letter-groups, that's of limited apparent value), and Genre (e.g. Movie, Lifestyle, Childrens.)  And it's faster.Device Support:TV Listings completely ignores Landscape mode.  Even with the physical keyboard open, it's Landscape.  TV Guide supports Landscape somewhat; things rotate (easier to type in searches), but the ribbon bar with \"Search\", \"Favorites\", etc. is blank.Neither program allows you to scroll to the next timeslot with a finger-swipe.TV Listings U.I. Notes:My biggest gripe with TV Listings is that every action incurs a delay.The Listing screen is nice; it shows the current and next few shows for each channel.  On my device, that's four channels per screen.  Clicking on the channel shows the listing for that channel.\"Return\" does what I would expect in TV Listings.TV Guide U.I. Notes:My biggest gripe with the TV Guide U.I. is that the \"return\" button, which should go to the previous screen, instead tries to exit the app.The Listing screen shows the current show... what you are probably used to seeing.  Five per screen on my device, with space also taken by a large ribbon (\"TV Listings\", \"Favorites\", \"Search\", \"News\"), by the nave list and by a blank space that may typically be used for advertising.  (Most ad servers are blocked on my phone.)To see every show on a channel, click on the channel icon on the Listings page and choose a day.Summary: This is an odd situation where you can't go RIGHT with either choice.  TV Listings has a terrible search-results presentation and dreadful lag, and killed my battery.  TV Guide has lag I would have considered dreadful if not for TV Listings being worse, an abysmal filter/favorites configuration and bad choice of how to use the \"return\" key.  But I find the TV Guide search facility far more useful than the TV Listings one, because being able to easily search across times is the really important part of \"search\".Update 20 April 2012: A year later, I tried it again.  And still the same flaws.  Even on the Kindle Fire.  Default providers - 1300 or so channels for Dish.  You must deselect or select manually; it can't even distinguish between HD and standard def, so by default you get two copies of many channels.  And the Search is still only for the specifically selected time... you can't find a movie or when the show will next be on, just what's on now.Which means that not only was this weak a year ago, but it hasn't improved.  Huh.","overall":3.0,"summary":"Not so great","unixReviewTime":1307923200,"reviewTime":"06 13, 2011","_etag":"6209d2f5b4bbcbf77311fcd7a58be69c8b29c359","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-19T11:45:55.000Z"},"requirement_type":"non-functional requirement"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd3dfa02974cb6478a2"},"reviewerID":"A3JCD6OPZ05407","asin":"B004AZH4C8","reviewerName":"E.

I'm dyslexic and have always found numbers and letters matrix difficult to follow.  I'll never overcome the problem but I hope to patch it up a bit.  This app has been a terrific aid in learning the Sudoku puzzles and although I still make a lot of mistakes I believe the game and this app have helped me.  BUT there is an annoying rating (or grading) page at the end of the puzzles that pops up and reminds me that some super duper whizz bang player/s completed the same puzzle in seven to ten percent of the time it took me and that sometimes dozens of others completed it in less than twenty percent of my time.  In my view Sudoku is like golf where the player's biggest opponent is the player him/her self.  A golfer completes a round and finishes first in a foursome only to have someone in the clubhouse announce \"that score stinks compared to the top finishers at \"The Masters\".  I realize this reads like sour grapes from a looser but like golf and other competitions the players take to the same fields of competition but the super players are only ranked against those of equal skill and talent.Other wise I rate this full five star app.","overall":4.0,"summary":"Very Good BUT","unixReviewTime":1371168000,"reviewTime":"06 14, 2013","_etag":"10c0ef06130838af57cd3ae363264b36141be912","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-19T11:47:10.000Z"},"requirement_type":"functional requirement"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd3dfa02974cb6478a6"},"reviewerID":"A3PCCHN4Q629U5","asin":"B004AZH4C8","reviewerName":"Eric A.

The nicest part about this program is that it actually teaches you how to solve the puzzles.

You get to choose the level of difficulty for your puzzle.  The difficulty levels correspond to the difficulty of the techniques required to solve that level of puzzle.  So if you don't want to solve puzzles with XYZ-Wings in them, you pick a lower difficulty level.  If you can't tell the difference between chicken wings and W-Wings, this game will teach you as you play it.The hint system is fantastic.  You can auto-pencil your puzzle quickly so that you just spend time on the 'logic' part of Sudoku.  Additionally a hint is always available and has several levels.  The first level tells you where to look or for what type of restriction to look for.  The next level shows you exactly where it is at and the type or restrictions.  The next level steps you through the reasoning for that specific restrictions and its consequences.  So you can learn more about Sudoku while you are playing it.  During these steps there are links directly to a wiki that has even more detailed explications of each restriction so you can get as much or as little information as you want.My kid was never really as into Sudoku as I was until he spotted me playing this version.  The fact that the hints and highlighting work so well has drawn him into the game.  When we play now, he bumps up the difficulty levels just so he can see the explanations of the techniques we haven't mastered yet.If you like Sudoku, this is the game to get.  If nothing else, try the free version which lets you play a single game of each difficulty level once per day.

I liked the interface better than Andoku free, which I liked but have since uninstalled in favor of this one. There are a couple things missing that I'd love to see added:The Undo-Redo stack works very well. I'd love to see a bookmarking feature. With a really hard puzzle, I reach the point where I do trial-and-error. When I get to a error, it would be good to be able to go directly back to a bookmark set at the first trial, rather than having to back up through the Undo stack.Another computer-aided Sudoku I have lets me colorize cells - just set them to red or blue - which can be handy when thinking through what-ifs.Third feature I miss is a forced-moves button. Once you've cracked the puzzle, and you're down to changing all the single-choice pencil marks to entries, it would be great if the program could be told to fill those in for you.None of these are dealbreakers, and as it stands this app is still the best on Android that I've seen, so it gets 5 stars.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Nice app, with some suggestions for improvement","unixReviewTime":1305331200,"reviewTime":"05 14, 2011","_etag":"ece2461d92d4cf7c624ae0438f959f37c0db192f","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-19T11:55:15.000Z"},"requirement_type":"functional requirement"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd4dfa02974cb6478ca"},"reviewerID":"A6JRT1C5VDH1R","asin":"B004AZH4C8","reviewerName":"Jim Walker \"jjw92\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Great app. Lots of levels and hints if you get stuck (doesn't just full in the answer, it teaches you why).

Now that I have this app, I play everyday, several games a day. On the weekends I usually even try to play each difficulty level each day, and play for an hour or more, and I never get bored.I love the layout and gameplay. My favorite feature is how the numbers light up. It makes playing more obvious, the games move faster and are much more enjoyable. The controls such as adding numbers and pencil marks and erasing numbers are very simple, but not totally intuitive. It did take me a bit to get the hang of the two different ways to type in numbers.The many levels, with new levels each day makes me want to come back everyday. And the stats that are kept, of my personal best times on each difficulty when using hints or not, using auto pencil or not (I've only used auto pencil once, actually, just to see what it did. Seems like it kinda takes away the whole point of playing sudoku), and then showing me my time vs everyone else's time on that same game.Everything about this game is wonderful and this is the best way to play sudoku, either by hand our digitally.","overall":5.0,"summary":"So addicting!

I think it's worth the price.","overall":5.0,"summary":"best sudoku app","unixReviewTime":1333670400,"reviewTime":"04 6, 2012","_etag":"db42f57bb2157dcb0a8b2d70cee7f633e2dd5569","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-19T20:20:57.000Z"},"requirement_type":"other"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd3dfa02974cb647844"},"reviewerID":"A21S75KZQKVQLB","asin":"B004ANMWPY","reviewerName":"Wendy L.

I'm pretty sure I won't download another Sudoku app after downloading Enjoy Sudoku. Why? Because Enjoy Sudoku does everything that I need in a Sudoku app already.Not only does it offer a huge number of difficulty levels, but it also helps you with hints when you get stuck. I'm sure a lot of people never use the hints, because they are either too proud or because the hints are too straightforward thus ruining the game. However, the hints feature in this app addresses both of those concerns. When you're stuck and press the hint button, it gives you a vague hint like \"Concentrate on a certain number, row, or column.\" If this hint is too vague for you, you can press the more button and it will explain the hint further and you can keep hitting more until it basically gives you the answer. The reason why this feature is great, is that it teaches you Sudoku techniques without making you go through a boring tutorial and instead uses real game situations. Of course, if you want to go through a tutorial instead, they have that as well!To sum it up, if you're looking for a simple, easy to use Sudoku app, this is it! If you're looking for an advanced Sudoku app with the hardest puzzles, advanced techniques, and more, this is also it!

I review here Enjoy Sudoku (ES) for the KF.Enjoy Sudoku is one of the best board-type game applications I've ever seen, across all forms of games, across several platforms.The display is beautiful. I typically play with my KF in portrait position. I've tried landscape; it works perfectly, but it's just not to my taste. The highlighting of completed row/box is useful. Highlighting \"all number N used\" is extremely helpful, but having the display flash in different colors takes a bit of getting used to.The user controls are OK:- Entering choices using the box-first approach is intuitive. Entering number-first-then-box is claimed to be faster, but again, it takes some getting used to. (Because of the highlighting feature, I've not been able to get used to it because of the way the colors change back and forth.)- The undo/back-track command is really great. I haven't yet found how deep the undo stack is, but I've exercised it pretty well, I think.- I've used the rotate/mirror commands only once, but the change of viewpoint enabled me to finish a \"fiendish\" (toughest level) puzzle. Bravo.- I have yet to figure out what other command buttons do - from my perspective, ES behaves just a tad strangely when some buttons are pressed. I suppose I should read the manual, but a perfect app is written so all controls are intuitive.A truly strong point of ES is the range of available daily games: there are FOURTEEN levels, ranging from trivial to, well, really really (near impossibly) hard. Winner, winner, chicken dinner. There is a slight discontinuity in difficulty: the game takes a big jump somewhere around \"moderate\" or \"intricate.\" I can live with that. Starting over doesn't impact time-to-complete scoring (I'm divided on this one).At the end of a game, you get some feedback with a rough percentile chart. Sorta informative. It would be nicer if there was an absolute ranking; \"User_name is 483 of 10 zillion\" could be rewarding to players.I really recommend this app to KF owners.","overall":5.0,"summary":"KILLER APP on KF!!!","unixReviewTime":1324252800,"reviewTime":"12 19, 2011","_etag":"8cc20b61079f763ca9a4abf323359bdc8b674b3d","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-20T13:17:43.000Z"},"requirement_type":"other"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd5dfa02974cb647921"},"reviewerID":"AHJVPW7ULBUNK","asin":"B004AZH4C8","reviewerName":"redfshbluefsh","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"I paid for this - the ad free version; don't know what the free version is like.

Not because it's perfect - the resolution on my XOOM could be higher and the game is not as responsive to tilting the tablet as it should be - but because I just love playing it. It's got a definite retro, arcade feeling and, unlike something that you could have played back in the late 80's/early 90's, it responds to your gadget's accelerometer. And, with unlimited ammo, missiles and lots more surprises, it's just plain, no apologies fun.I got mine as the free Amazon 'app of the day' but it's worth the admission price from anyone looking for a simple but fun arcade game.P.S. - the game allows for 'keyboard' controls and I was in fact able to play it off a bluetooth keyboard paired with my tablet but why would anyone want to do that?

Schmidt","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Test devices:Samsung Epic, Android 2.2 officialViewsonic gTablet, Calkulin+Clemsyn 1.5ghz Froyo Combo V6There are tons of side scrolling shooters out there, and Overkill is just one of them.  Boasting superior graphics and sound always attracts my attention, so I snatched up this title as soon as I could.On my little Epic, I was able to kick in all the eye candy Overkill offered and still maintain over 50 frames per second.  Everything was very smooth, not a single glitch or hiccup.  I even enabled the fast load option and didn't encounter an issue.  Everything was nicely detailed and crystal clear.  Very, very nice.  On the gTablet, things didn't fare so well.  Averaging 45 frames per second, everything did work, and worked just as smoothly as it did on the Epic, but the graphics were *so* not superior.  They are all fuzzy and lacking detail.  I toggled every option in every combination possible and still they barely entered medicore range. Sorry guys, try again.  As for the sound, yeah, it's pretty good.  Clear sound effects and a good background soundtrack.On both my devices, the accelerometer control was dead on perfect.  I like that Overkill recalibrates at the beginning of each level, adjusting itself to how you're holding the device at the time.  This allows you to to play the game in pretty much any position you want.  In game recalibration is also there, to give you a chance to fix things up if they aren't to your liking.  Doing some good thinking, Overkill's dev also put in sensitivity adjustment, which will allow the game to be adjusted to the device and gamer's preferred style of play.  Keyboard/touchscreen controls worked just as well, with nary a missed movement or sluggish response.  Sorry, I don't own a Zeemote, so I was unable to test this function.The game itself is what I would consider a complete title.  Besides running through a storylined campaign mode, there is is a test mode, quick mission mode, and survival mode, all of which extend the replay level.  Multiple difficulty levels can be played, with the difficulty level factored into your score.  The computer AI's lines are only slightly cheesy, and often humorous.  As is typical with games of this genre, weapons upgrades are available and new weapon types appear at different parts of the games.  A complete help section is built in, with links back to the dev's site for yet more information.  Gameplay is action packed, with no laggy spots.  The one thing I don't particularly care for, besides the less than stellar graphics on the tablet, is the use of the screen real estate.  In general, I think all the objects are too big, giving the gameplay a cramped feeling.With all that praise, why only three stars?  Simple - if you're going to make a lot of hoopla about the graphics and don't deliver, that's a double negative for me.  Get that fixed up, and it's a 4-5 star title.I hope you found this review helpful, and if not, feel free to leave comments/question","overall":3.0,"summary":"Eye candy?","unixReviewTime":1313539200,"reviewTime":"08 17, 2011","_etag":"983731420db97f7727a3b78cd7b77b599b725fd4","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-19T12:34:48.000Z"},"requirement_type":"other"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd5dfa02974cb647970"},"reviewerID":"AQ29AWZVZI4KD","asin":"B004AZSY4K","reviewerName":"D.

It is challenging, and not just because the controls are tough.  It takes a little while to figure out what is going on in the game, but the learning curve isn't too steep.  They give you three control options.  First is tiling the screen to use the accelerometer to control the ship.  This is extremely difficult, though novel, and might be a good way to do it if you're used to it.  The second way is by using the touchscreen, which is a little finicky, and can be challenging when your fingers are in the way of your view, but they worked the best for me.  The third is to use some sort of controller (Wii-mote maybe?) which would probably be ideal, but I haven't gotten around to trying that yet.

Another,  annoying thing is that one has to have the big brother app from amazon installed to run it, yet no updates were ever made available, nor can they be installed from a third party site (app publisher, other sources). Check nikkotwenty's website, this app has had multiple releases and, importantly, bug fixes, while this outdated app remains here in amazon's app store, just like when I bought it.Too bad; I really hoped that amazon would put up a good showing vs. the G**gle store to keep competition up, but this experience was enough to put me off buying apps on amazon. I buy a lot of other stuff from them, but no more Android apps.One star for both amazon and the seller for selling a way-outdated app, not providing any updates and preventing me from updating it directly.","overall":1.0,"summary":"Version was already outdated when purchased, Amazon Appstore fails to come through","unixReviewTime":1369440000,"reviewTime":"05 25, 2013","_etag":"08ac179c8c3801e4704a1a2b21ae50505cba767e","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-19T12:45:08.000Z"},"requirement_type":"other"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd6dfa02974cb6479e5"},"reviewerID":"A3JP59C3MFUEWN","asin":"B004BN3YQE","reviewerName":"brhodes","helpful":[4,6],"reviewText":"seems pretty challenging at times.

But, I didn't like the fact that I had to discover the second ship and it seems that all the money i spent upgrading weapons seems to be lost when I buy another weapon, there was no information / warning about this. I wouldn't doubt that there's a tutorial or manual somewhere, but shouldn't \"tips\" like these be given in game?I beat the ten lvls and a msg says new bonus levels unlocked, but that's a hollow victory. I haven't tried the quick games / bonus lvls yet, don't know if I want to.When I first tried this game, the controls were strange. you can choose zeemote, tilt+turn phone, or touchscreen + Dpad. Since i don't own a zeemote, i can't comment. the tilt+turn was hard, it always is and I wouldn't recommend it with a fast game like this, i also didn't see a way to actually adjust its sensitivity. The touch screen was too hard to do on my phone since my thumb basically covered the ship, it's like my bullets / lasers were coming from my thumb. the dpad worked fine with some adjustments to the sensitivity.

Wilson","helpful":[15,15],"reviewText":"Reviewed on HTC Thunderbolt \u0026 Asus TransformerNice game decent graphics in the 2d side shooter genre, think old school Defender with a few differences.On the Thunderbolt, I found the controls to be resposive and the gameplay smooth and challenging. Decent graphics, several game modes, and challenging gameplay make for a fun game.I noticed in the description it said it was redesigned to support tablets, so I expected HD graphics or improved controls or something, I did not see any optimization on my Transformer running Honeycomb 3.2, the 3.2 software sizes the game to fill the screen resulting in less resolution and stretched graphics for apps that aren't optimized for tablets. This appeared to be the case with this game.So the look wasn't optimized, next to check controls.Upon attempting to play the game using the acceleometer, I found that it was wanting me to control it as though it were in portrait mode but was in landscape, thereby making it unplayable using that method. Next I used screen control method with better results but found the controls using this method difficult although playable on a 10.1 inch screen. So, unless I'm missing another tablet version of this game, it definitely isn't optimized and is barely playable at least on Asus Transformers. As it is only \"redesigned to support\" tablets and only optimized for the Galaxy  Tab (really, why only that one?), I guess I couldn't expect too much, but most games are playable with 3.2, I don't know how the controls could get messed up so much, but I digress.So bottom line, this was great on my Thunderbolt, ran perfectly, but for a supposedly \"tablet supported\" game it failed badly on my Transformer, so if that's all you have to use apps on, I'd skip this for now.Anyhow, as long as you aren't buying this for your Transformer it's a good game, at $2 it's higher than most, and I'm not sure I'd pay more than a buck, but it is a good game overall and if you like Defender type games you'll like this.Feel free to comment but know that Amazon will not allow me to reply. Long story, but basically, if I were you I wouldn't reply to any of the troll reviews or correct others misconceptions, Amazon will ban you for criticising others reviews.

This app has almost no permissions, which is GREAT.  So what reason it has to be stationed on the internal storage is a mystery.  It's not a critical utility app that may require it to load on the boot, nor does it contain a widget.... so WHY?  Why ruin an otherwise very decent, low-permissions app with that horrible oversight?  And I'm very happy to not see social networking components like Feint in the app, but is there any good reason not to at least keep internal scoring and add a permission to write to the SD for that purpose?  I'm shaking my head on why this developer wouldn't do these two simple things to make the app more valuable.  The gameplay was great.  I had no problems with boredom and the like.  I don't need to be entertained by little birds perched on wire that fly away when you select a letter.  This app is clearly for adults looking for content rather than primarily \"graphic bling.\"  One other suggestion:  Lose the italics.  Word game people who like to play for extended periods of time of more than 10 minutes will begin to find the italic print irritating and not as easy for the eyes to adjust to.If the italics are removed, internal scoring is added, and it gets moved to the external SD, I'll be back to happily change this rating to a 5-star one.

You are given a limited number hits, but as the bubbles burst they will do some of the popping for you.The trick is to figure out which bubbles to hit to cause a chain reaction of bubble popping splendor!A good time waster.

Objectively, the scope of this app - take near-complete control of my desktop (and yes, it comes with custom icons and themes) - was enough of a concern for me to remove it shortly after installation. I asked myself how other, more modest add-ons would perform while dxTop was in charge and I find the answer quickly. \"Application Folder Pro\", my favorite folder organizer was unusable under the new management. Others apps and widgets may be preempted but that's as far as my investigation went.If accepted as the alternative interface, the app is deep and complex enough to demand quite a substantial time investment but that would be okay if the rewards justified the effort. In my case (XOOM, Honeycomb) they don't. I wasn't able to justify allowing a \"vendor's\" app to make phone calls on my behalf without me knowing it, just to mention one of the more intrusive rights you grant the app as you install it. And, on a more parochial note, dxTop was stuck in 'portrait' on my XOOM. There may be some setup option that might change that to 'auto-rotate' but I removed dxTop before I found it.For 'positives', this does appear to be a well-thought, well-designed overlay but it's a radical departure from Android's way of interacting with the end-user so one of the first questions that popped into my mind was: if they believe that Android's interface deserves to be so completely wiped out, why not produce their own mobile OS? Seriously.In the Android world what I need and in fact I welcome at this time is 'helpers' such as 'App Folder Pro', not a new boss. dxTop tries to make itself the boss and I have not use for that.","overall":2.0,"summary":"The better mouse trap?","unixReviewTime":1314662400,"reviewTime":"08 30, 2011","_etag":"994607b9f91bf91e3c0a45df0bc1d12afd915d57","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-22T13:41:37.000Z"},"requirement_type":"non-functional requirement"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd7dfa02974cb647b40"},"reviewerID":"AIQXFVUUFF5JR","asin":"B004DLNBDA","reviewerName":"A.Ndroid","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"I liked the idea and used it on my Optimus T for a while but it ran like a dog!

For some reason they think this means the chords shown don't apply to the 5 string banjo. They are wrong. After looking at a few chords, it's clear to me -- a bluegrass banjo player with more than a decade of experience -- that this app is indeed showing chords for the 5 string banjo in open G tuning. The app does only show 4 strings, but there's a very good reason for that: THAT'S HOW CHORDS ARE MADE ON THE 5-STRING BANJO! Only in very rare situations does anyone fret the 5th string while making a chord. So why would the app show it?That aside, I give this only three stars because important voicings of chords are missing. For example, select a D major chord. Only two voicings are shown: the barre chord at the 7th fret and a pitch-correct but mangled version of the canonical D position with the root voiced on the second string, third fret. The fingering shown is mangled (at least in the bluegrass world) because it shows the chord played with the fourth string open. While technically a valid voicing, the chord is not usually played with the fourth string open. Instead, the fourth string is usually fretted at the fourth fret, putting an F# on the bass string, allowing this position to be quickly moved to the closed G chord at the 9th fret, the closed A at the 11th fret, etc. Octaves of the chords are not indicated either -- where's the closed F-shape G chord at the 17th fret? Not shown, that's where. Where's the closed D-shape G chord at the 9th fret? Also not shown.I was hoping this would be an app I could recommend to my banjo students, but at this point I can't make that recommendation.","overall":3.0,"summary":"This IS for 5-string banjo","unixReviewTime":1328313600,"reviewTime":"02 4, 2012","_etag":"dca5979204929cce9888deeb52e43a78544b4276","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-22T13:43:53.000Z"},"requirement_type":"other"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd7dfa02974cb647b29"},"reviewerID":"A1I5JSKFAZXSJ2","asin":"B004DLLNFS","reviewerName":"zombman","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Works perfectly fine on my kindle fire 2nd gen.Never know when you will need a level.Don't know yet about the internet connection thing.","overall":5.0,"summary":"yeah!

Love these, and customizing was the whole reason for leaving the iPhone behind.  I've tried out lots of them, ADW, Launcher Pro, VTL, and more, settling in on Go Launcher EX for my phone and tablet. Along comes dxTop Pro, and I'm ready to give it a go.Comparing against my previous experience, dxTop Pro isn't too shabby.  It has lots of customization built in, including an iPhone-like lock screen replacement.  There are a fair number of themes for it, but many will cost you and there aren't nearly as many as there are for other launchers.  On both devices, the performance felt laggy, not as snappy as what I'm used to.  Flipping between screens rapidly, say from all the way left to all the way right, invariably stalled and required a second swipe to get to the last screen.  Looking that the resources being used, dxTop Pro eats up a good bit more than Go Launcher EX (22-30MB vs 17-21MB). The included screen capture is a nice idea, but had a tendency to stick and shoot multiple shots.  The captured images didn't include the wallpaper, which is a bummer.  Sadly, the screen capture only worked outside of applications.  The folder setup is depreciated from stock, in that you have to manually put items into the folders one at a time.  On the plus side, you can change the folder icon to whatever you like, including photos.To sum it all up, dxTop has a bunch of cool little features but they come at a price.  Perhaps as it matures it will get better. I'll hang onto it for a bit but have a feeling I'll be back to Go Launcher EX within a week or two.I hope you found this review helpful, and if not, feel free to leave comments/questions","overall":3.0,"summary":"Pretty good","unixReviewTime":1314662400,"reviewTime":"08 30, 2011","_etag":"1382b4bb73d3c92ac0228e4e4a051f1425905b92","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-24T12:33:42.000Z"},"requirement_type":"non-functional requirement"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd7dfa02974cb647b73"},"reviewerID":"ASEN809C7FUVI","asin":"B004DLNBDA","reviewerName":"DancerInTheDark","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"nothing great.

The features of this app led me to taking a chance, and I'm glad I did. After changing the default 'cube' transitions to sliding, it works without any noticeable slowdown or other issues. I had to reposition my shortcuts, but all of the widgets I use work flawlessly. There are enough options that you can really tailor the UI to your needs.Where this really shines is on my Viewsonic gTablet, running VeganTab. The 'stock' UI has some weird oddities like displaying a Phone icon that does nothing, and this app allows you to tailor the UI into something more gTab-friendly.Remember, incompatibility with your device is an issue to report to the developer, not to rate poorly. If the features of this app sound appealing, it's worth a try.

The description touts the diamond pattern layout of the windows, and that is the greatest thing this app brings to the table, which I have not seen in any other launcher so far. Makes you wonder why no one else came up with the idea to lay out your screens to minimize swipe after swipe to get to what you're looking for.Unfortunately, that's also the only great thing I see here. The app drawer appears forgotten, lacking the ability to drag and sort, or create folders to group apps in. (GoLauncher does this for free, btw) The interface has a little sluggishness to it, which never helps. It runs okay on my Thunderbolt (rooted and running DasBAMF 1.8.6 Remix), and looks kindof like crap on my Galaxy Tab 10.1 (stock), (but so far, everything else does too, so no love lost here).Then there is the killer, which took this from a four star app to three, and I even considered two because this was the reason I uninstalled: when my phone reboots I get a message several times telling me that Amazon AppStore is no longer installed. I assume this nuisance alert appears because some Amazon service is still starting up, but why should my app launcher care what market/store I have installed?

I have both a base station scanner in my house and a hand held scanner for mobile use when I go on trips but i'll bet they haven't been turned on more than ten or fifteen times in the years that I've had them. Listening to scanner calls as a steady diet is somewhat distracting to me. As a point of reference I was a licensed ham radio operator and CB radio operator. I never put my mobile transceiver in my car at all any more nor turn on my base station radio transceiver anymore either. I don't think my base station transceiver's antenna coaxial cable is even hooked up to the radio anymore as well. For you scanner junkies out there the Scanner Radio app will work just fine on your tablet or android phone and you can listen to scanner calls to your heart's content.

I listen to it while I'm getting ready for work in the morning, and I know exactly where all the traffic problems are.On holidays, when I make the rounds, I keep this on in the car. I have not been surprised once. LOVE it! Not only does it keep my driver's license clean, it has proven to be awfully entertaining.A few months ago, I switched to one of the local police or emergency dispatches for a few minutes. I heard some chatter about a seventy-something male, collapsed in his home.. heard some vitals reported... I thought to myself, wow this is a terrible morning in someone's household right now and paused to hope for them in silence as I walked out to the main area of the house. I realized my dogs were outside barking and I could hear heavy engines running. I watched in shock as my elderly neighbor was taken out on a stretcher and loaded up. A female police officer carried his little grand daughter (who is always out in the front yard helping him) out, still in her pajamas. I was convinced I'd heard their situation, but I guess you can't be sure.I just listen to the Highway Patrol mostly now. They seem to always get called when the local police are too busy to answer calls. Sometimes it's hilarious! On Thanksgiving, there was chatter along the lines of...\"Bob, you going to bring anything for the lunch? Everybody's got their stuff there already and we were wondering if you had decided what to do.\" .... \"uuuum. What is missing I'll pick something up.\"  \"You could get some Pepsi.\"  \"Mmmkay. I'll probably be over in a few\"  but then there was a call about a woman with a history of mental illness pounding on her landlord's door and threatening to kill herself.

They do not hold back on features.  You will see some ads.  Remember, people making these apps need to make money too.  What they have done right (so many companies need to learn this!) is they offer you a very robust free app with subtle ads that do not get in the way of the fun of listening.  That said.... I think you get your money's worth by spending (literally) a couple bucks and going pro.As the two are so similar, I am going to post my review of Pro below.  My advice to users is to try the free one to see if you like listening into scanners at all --and if you do, support these guys.  Their app is the best one, as far as I can tell, for this.----------scanner pro review-------------My phone is getting long in the tooth so it's nice to see these apps come to kindle.  Some countries are making their feeds digital and encrypting them now since, it's one thing to  offer up police feeds to the public when the \u0026#34;public\u0026#34; consists of folks in their homes who monitor scanners for any number of reasons (boredom / fun, EMT's /etc.) \u0026#60;--these users had to go out and buy a scanner, set it up, and get feeds in their own town.  It's something else to allow everyone on the street to listen in on police business....for example, a criminal getting tipped off when they hear that the cops are on their way to a warehouse the thief is in the process of robbing.Do the benefits that come with the increased amount of good people (the by far largest percentage of users) who might be the ones doing the helpful reporting now that they feel \u0026#34;hooked in\u0026#34; outweigh the harm of putting a police scanner in the hands of any criminal with a phone/tablet and a couple bucks.....Any answer is outside the scope of the product review.  For this product, you should know:1.  Currently you can get feeds in most cities / the app is very good about keeping users up to date on new feeds added/taken2.  Users can see the number of listeners on any feed and also the type of feed (police /sometimes called \u0026#34;law\u0026#34;/, EMT/medical and Fire/Safety...there are also feeds for train stations and airports)3.  Most digital feeds are outside the USA, such as in Australia (although they have some great feeds online now) and the UK4.  If your fav city goes off line, it may come back up.  The network depends on users who broadcast feeds from their scanners5.  This is legal - in the USA (I am not familiar with the culture of other countries on this), you should not get into hot water or even a bad look from a cop if one sees you listening to this.)  But be considerate and don't do it when they are pulling you over -haha6.  I've tried about 5 of these programs...this is by far the best.7.  The app also has many free and/or paid \u0026#34;modules\u0026#34; such as one for chat.  I have not used chat yet as I typically use this app to fall asleep, but I imagine it can be fun.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Free version of Scanner Radio Pro","unixReviewTime":1387670400,"reviewTime":"12 22, 2013","_etag":"58675c7cd51940e02e28700d1af6e6110dd3f154","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-25T13:48:31.000Z"},"requirement_type":"other"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd7dfa02974cb647d39"},"reviewerID":"A1HRAQGCE6V88J","asin":"B004DLNC4I","reviewerName":"D.

I have spent many hours with it and love the fact that I can go more than a week with minimal use without having to plug it in. When using it heavily, I still get two or three days between charges. Remembering how I had to plug my HTC Thunderbolt in every night without fail even if I didn't use it for anything but a couple of calls, THIS device is fantastic in that regard. That said, when I added this app to it one evening (and ONLY this app) my battery was dead the next morning after going to bed with it at 82%. I went through all my settings to make sure I had it set overnight the same way as always (bluetooth off, GPS off, airplane mode, etc.) and everything was correct. I plugged it in for a couple of hours to get it back to 100%, didn't use it much all day and by the time I went to bed, the battery was back down to 10%! I'm the kind of guy who's pretty good with electronics, so I went through everything to see if anything was out of the ordinary. The battery use log showed \"85% display\" for the reason the battery was depleted but the display had been off all night and all day; the ONLY thing different was this one single app I had downloaded. I uninstalled it, plugged my Tab in to fully charge it and then went 10 entire days before I had to plug it in again! Just for the fun of it, two weeks later I reinstalled it and the same exact scenario played itself out all over again.

I would hazard a guess that most of us have a favorite or two or three set frequencies if you will, well, with this app, you can set up your favorites list and you can just pick and chose which one you want to listen to for the first hour or two.  Or maybe one of your favorites is quiet tonight, you take a chance and see whats going on in the land down under, yep, we can listen to the brave men and women in uniform in Australia.  While its no hand held scanner that you can set up, program, have an antenna on the roof of your home and all, bt this isn't a bad substitute, try it, couldn't hurt, you may just be the next action junkie.

Pruss","helpful":[20,23],"reviewText":"It does the job, sort of.  But for being the only ebook reader app for the most popular source of ebooks--namely, Amazon--it is very sadly lacking in features.  Just compare to ebook readers like Moon+ or Mantano and Android, or even ebook readers on obsolete platforms like Plucker for PalmOS (which I was a developer for).My comments are skewed by the fact that I am a scholar in the humanities, and so my needs are for study rather than just linear reading.Here are some specifics:1. The search is unacceptably slow.  For instance, to search my approximately 6mb ebook, it took six minutes on my Archos 43.  Compare that to 22 seconds with Moon+, or about 50 seconds with Plucker on PalmOS on a much slower device (200MHz versus 1000MHz).  Search is the main advantage of electronic texts for serious students of the texts.  Without a decent speed search, there is little advantage except convenience.  And it would be good to have some more search options (phrase, word, boolean, etc.).2. The subpixel font rendering assumes horizontal RGB striping.  This means that the subpixel algorithm fails, producing faint color shadows near letters, in all orientations other than one (on my Archos 43, it works in portrait, but fails in others;  on my wife's Kindle Fire, it works in landscape, but fails in others).  It's not such a big deal on my Archos 43, as the pixels on it are so small.  This is easy to fix: just turn off subpixel rendering and replace it with grayscale antialiasing, or add an option to do that.  And I bet it works badly in all orientations on OLED devices that don't use uniform RGB stripes at all.  (The best would be to auto-detect based on orientation and screen type.  But I don't know if Android includes an API for getting RGB striping information.  On the Kindle Fire's version of the app, though, you could just go on orientation, since you know which way the RGB is striped there.)  Subpixel rendering for the wrong orientation is worse than grayscale rendering.3. More color options, please.  It would take only a few minutes for the developer to add a bunch more color options.  (I know, because I'm a developer for a PDF viewer for Android.)  For instance, green on black is great for reading at night.  Red on black is essential if you want to preserve night vision.  Black on sepia is nicer than brown on sepia.  And why not just let the user customize it?4. I wish the viewer would optionally let you move through the text by scrolling rather than paging.  Paging isn't quite so good for complex scholarly texts, as it's harder to think about a sentence or paragraph that is broken across screens.  Much easier if you can just scroll it so the text you're thinking about fits on one screen.5. There should be an option to eliminate all margins (on a small screen device, one doesn't need more than about two pixels).  The tightest margin setting still has too much margin.6. Optionally, make the main screen be just a list of titles, like on eink Kindles.  Lists with book cover thumbnails make sense only for small collections of books, and presumably you'd like users to have large connections. :-)7. I can't find a way to categorize books.  There should be one.What do I like?- stability- easy downloads- correct formatting- number of books available","overall":3.0,"summary":"Not enough features, slow searching, poor font rendering","unixReviewTime":1328400000,"reviewTime":"02 5, 2012","_etag":"cbd6ea06e8e28b11ae563cc686932ff2d074663c","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-28T13:26:50.000Z"},"requirement_type":"non-functional requirement"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd7dfa02974cb648061"},"reviewerID":"A3O6VNTOF7DB1T","asin":"B004DLPXAO","reviewerName":"altair","helpful":[0,1],"reviewText":"I mean its an app that you can use on any device and you will enjoy it easy to organize books and anything else you can store on it","overall":5.0,"summary":"Review","unixReviewTime":1354838400,"reviewTime":"12 7, 2012","_etag":"bf77aefc2cffea62696020980f1682ed802edf03","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-28T13:27:03.000Z"},"requirement_type":"other"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd7dfa02974cb64806d"},"reviewerID":"A33B95XABJ6BP0","asin":"B004DLPXAO","reviewerName":"Amanda","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Wish pulling my books from the app to store on a thumb drive etc. Was a bit easier.

I am currently using the Kindle app for a school book (math) and frequently have to jump around.

Lots of ways to page through a book - swipe, tap, volume buttons, and a scroll bar at the bottom to go to a specific section quickly.  There's also the Go To page accessed through the Menu key through which you can jump to a specific section or to a passage you have marked. Love love love the WhisperSync - you can get access to the book you purchased wherever you are. You can highlight words and passages and create notes. Day and night display settings are available as well as setting the brightness.There are two main drawbacks that keep me from giving it a full five stars - one is the limited number of sorting and view options. There's grid and list view, and sort by Author, Title, and Most Recent and that's it. I would like some way to create custom collections or bookshelves or even pages. I thought the PC version would be more complete, but sadly it isn't.  The other big drawback is the limited number of formats it supports natively. You may convert your other e-books to one of those formats, or if you have a Kindle, then you can send your books to be converted to your Kindle email and you'll get a reply with the attached books converted. It's not a huge huge deal, but it's just another encumbrance to enjoying your book right away.","overall":4.0,"summary":"Review for Kindle on HTC Incredible","unixReviewTime":1301443200,"reviewTime":"03 30, 2011","_etag":"84547311b6c85c51efb536b59b7522c4511266d2","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-28T13:50:32.000Z"},"requirement_type":"functional requirement"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd7dfa02974cb64801c"},"reviewerID":"A3JWS57JSMYXQJ","asin":"B004DLPXAO","reviewerName":"A.

I personally prefer Adobe Digital Editions and the Nook apps (Barnes \u0026 Noble), but mostly just because I am more familiar, having used them both first, and I actually would rather have a paper book than any of them. If you need a decent reader app, this one is just as good as the next, so go ahead and try it out, just make sure to comparison shop.","overall":3.0,"summary":"Nothing exciting...","unixReviewTime":1363737600,"reviewTime":"03 20, 2013","_etag":"6ba241c8e1df0e0978aff20504b86bf39323f705","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-30T14:52:05.000Z"},"requirement_type":"other"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd7dfa02974cb648084"},"reviewerID":"AUOF5E9Y5NQ2W","asin":"B004DLPXAO","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"bleuunicorn\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"I have not been able to read a book since the new version loaded on my Android phone.

I have sci-fi, fantasy, romance, kids, religious, etc and the best that I can do is sort by author or title!!!  I'd even be fine if I had to go in and specify which book belonged in which category.Ideally, we'd also be able to then group books by author.  So if I'm in Fantasy and I have 12 books by Jim Butcher, I would like to see a single entry for the author and then in there I'd have all of his books.  An even better option would be under his name would be a group by series (again, I'm fine putting each book in the \"proper\" place).Overall, this is a great program, but it really does need a few more features to make it exceptional!","overall":4.0,"summary":"Excellent reader, but it still is lacking","unixReviewTime":1374019200,"reviewTime":"07 17, 2013","_etag":"6c3bb77ca46dad2ec91567ba3278ee006928b5cb","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-30T14:54:32.000Z"},"requirement_type":"functional requirement"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd7dfa02974cb64808e"},"reviewerID":"AH0VOYCA9X58H","asin":"B004DLPXAO","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"Carol\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"I've had a Droid DNA since the end of December 2012. The Kindle app came pre-installed. Up until the middle of September everything was great, \u0026 I use this app on several other Android devices as well. However, beginning sometime after Sept. 26, this app on my Droid DNA began consuming enormous amounts of data; so much so that on a 4GB plan shared by 4 family members, this app used almost 2 gigs of data between 9/26 and 10/18. On Oct 20 I turned the app off (cannot uninstall) and contacted Kindle Customer Service. The rep was not able to determine that anything was wrong. When the data usage cycle reset on Oct 26, I turned the app back on. By Oct 28, the app has used almost .5 Gb of data in those 3 days. I submitted a report to Kindle CS through the apps feedback link and today called them again to try to trouble shoot. Went through 2 reps who said they could determine nothing was wrong and then the call was disconnected. It took so long to do this, I didn't want to bother calling back.

I downloaded Launcher Pro, but didn't like the app drawer as much as I had the drawer in Go Launcher. I then remembered I hadn't checked amazon app store for awhile, and came and saw this so I downloaded it. My initial wasn't that great, it is as others have mention kind of confusing, but after playing around with it I am really fond of it.It comes with it's own lock screen similar to that of the Iphone, I'm not sure if that's an option in the settings because I did make some changes before I noticed it. The dock was at first weird to me, and it's hard to explain, it's a scroll-able dock, the main dock has  a home screen indicator in the middle, flanked by the dialer and contacts shortcuts, which can be changed to different programs, I changed contacts to gmail. On the next dock, you can drop any programs, and the third has the app drawer and running program drawer, both open by swiping upwards, you can also open the app drawer from the main dock, by swiping up.The drawer is my favourite part of this launcher, it has several options for how you get to your apps, which can be changed by hitting the menu button and clicking change view. What I didn't find in Launcher Pro, that's in Go Launcher is folders, or simply a way to organize my apps so I'm scrolling through them. Categories view is perfect for that. Another feature that I found is the ability to access app information, without going to the setting menu \u003e applications, etc menu. A long click, and you're able to go to the app info, to uninstall it or clear data, you're also able to find the app in the app store, set category and hide the app, all from a pop menu.In addition, this launcher offers screen capture settings, which is nice... There are themes and you can change the icons, it's a really nice app, but I think other Launchers have a larger fan base, so many wont convert, but they should give it a try.","overall":5.0,"summary":"I love it","unixReviewTime":1314662400,"reviewTime":"08 30, 2011","_etag":"9c1409030d7985428ab9eb588f5ae199078e468d","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-30T15:01:40.000Z"},"requirement_type":"other"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd7dfa02974cb647fd0"},"reviewerID":"A1QEF25673BO20","asin":"B004DLPCYG","reviewerName":"Denise VanVliet","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"This app came in handy while I was traveling to Southeast Asia and was very accurate.

It remembers the last page viewed, which is insufficient because jumping to the index or end notes to check something results in the Kindle app assuming that to be your new current reading progress. Unless you manually bookmarked the page every time, progress is lost.

It has been wonderful up until the holidays this year.I was doing a great deal of traveling and suddenly could not get to the books in my library on my desktop.  Since I could still access everything on my tablet I figured I would worry about it later when I was home again and had time to deal with it.  It took me two hours to fuss around and finally reload the entire program on my desk top to get that back.Then my tablet lost access to my books just when I was hundreds of miles from home with no time to fuss with the program.  It took THREE emails to Amazon before I got a response back. Once I had the time and was back home they were very helpful and I did FINALLY get the problem resolved.Now the question is  -  why did I have the issues to begin with?  I trusted to Kindle that my books would be available when I needed them, these problems caused me a great deal of lost productivity and inconvenience.  If I had been teaching when I needed the references it would have been a classroom disaster.  Before this mess up I would have given the program 5 stars, unfortunately it will be a long while before I fully trust it again.","overall":2.0,"summary":"Love it  - When it works","unixReviewTime":1388793600,"reviewTime":"01 4, 2014","_etag":"9574d6cc2dfd5492e47dad399e3ff5aafe19f2c7","_updated":{"$date":"2018-10-03T03:44:59.000Z"},"requirement_type":"functional requirement"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd7dfa02974cb647fff"},"reviewerID":"A36U0HQUEUULP7","asin":"B004DLPXAO","reviewerName":"A Customer","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"this app skips 2-4 pages everytime i flip the page.  ive changed font but cant even go to a certain page  please fix this.","overall":1.0,"summary":"skips pages","unixReviewTime":1324857600,"reviewTime":"12 26, 2011","_etag":"f64653333b07d55eb80d8146f1e033d00842508d","_updated":{"$date":"2018-10-03T04:03:54.000Z"},"requirement_type":"functional requirement"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd7dfa02974cb648013"},"reviewerID":"A1E9NFMLMVY61H","asin":"B004DLPXAO","reviewerName":"ADRStudio","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"before install backup the old version because you will need it.use Norton utilities to backup and restore the old version.","overall":1.0,"summary":"too big !","unixReviewTime":1325548800,"reviewTime":"01 3, 2012","_etag":"41cb25d190a604d933f8f0ef36b5392d8a7b7817","_updated":{"$date":"2018-10-03T04:03:59.000Z"},"requirement_type":"functional requirement"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd7dfa02974cb648009"},"reviewerID":"A1Y560OEDJZLRW","asin":"B004DLPXAO","reviewerName":"adamsbd4","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Easy to use, but it would be nice for removed items to be permanently removed from the library and not able to be viewed after they're deleted.","overall":4.0,"summary":"kindle review","unixReviewTime":1380931200,"reviewTime":"10 5, 2013","_etag":"554652424cb47789d9c27bc3ca7d857f04ac41ba","_updated":{"$date":"2018-10-03T04:04:12.000Z"},"requirement_type":"other"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd7dfa02974cb648023"},"reviewerID":"AMGHYZYA57QN1","asin":"B004DLPXAO","reviewerName":"Aidan's malmal \"Rhonda\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"I Love to read and this is great because I can download the book I want and don't have all the clutter of  all the books I have read stacked up everywhere.I usually give them away. this way I can erase them or keep them on my sd card.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Kindle from Amazon","unixReviewTime":1375660800,"reviewTime":"08 5, 2013","_etag":"56347c4ace05bb01bed873c9190a88c2698a9b61","_updated":{"$date":"2018-10-03T04:04:26.000Z"},"requirement_type":"other"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd7dfa02974cb648028"},"reviewerID":"A1I3DGE8BATVDX","asin":"B004DLPXAO","reviewerName":"ajmac1326","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"I so love that I don't have to carry my kindle around anymore - love being able to read on my phone and that when I open the books my place is saved no matter which device I'm using - this is my favorite app!","overall":5.0,"summary":"Love this new app...","unixReviewTime":1394668800,"reviewTime":"03 13, 2014","_etag":"b2c3a1c4c5137287de97574c48c0a15fb8d4bd28","_updated":{"$date":"2018-09-30T15:18:03.000Z"},"requirement_type":"other"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd7dfa02974cb648032"},"reviewerID":"ARW87U3SA9O71","asin":"B004DLPXAO","reviewerName":"Alan A.

The interface is still horrible though.  The home page is badly designed with too little information about my library and too much of Amazon trying to sell me things.  And it still has a problem displaying the text if I change the default.  I have several kindle store purchases that drop out words unless I change the font to the smallest/default setting.  It's like it can't figure out where the screen/page breaks should be at larger fonts and so doesn't display all of the words.In addition, they've removed useful features:-- You no longer see the name of the book and the chapter/story title when you center tap the screen.  Hello, McFly, some people read short story collections and knowing the title of the current short story is important.-- Still takes too many clicks to get to the ToC.  It takes 4 clicks now.  It shouldn't take more than 2.-- Books on the Device view defaults to large icons, basically two or three covers are all you can see at a time.Features it *still* lacks:-- Download all of my books in one click.  I've got a 32 gb sd card and wireless.  Like almost everyone else on the planet these days.  I shouldn't have to tap each book individually to download them.  There's easily room for over 250,000 novels on my device and I've got 100 MB wireless at work, 50 MB at home, and 4g.  It takes longer to tap than it does to download.-- Configure my home page.  I'd like the home page to be books on my device, not your sales pitch.  Lord knows Amazon gets enough of my money, just let me read what I've bought.  And let me customize the view.  I don't always need cover thumbnails either.  Just a title, author if sorting by title or author, title if sorting by author should be an option.Luckily I still have the last good apk from the 3.8 line.  I'll try newer versions every once in awhile, but I bet I'll be sticking with 3.8.  I wonder if there's calibre for android...[original review of 4.0 follows]The upgrade to 4.0 was horrible.  It locked up my phone, removed functionality, and basically made reading books purchased from Amazon impossible.  4.0.1.3 seems to have fixed the worst of the lockups, but it still doesn't work right.I've got a Galaxy Note2 and simply paging through a book would lock up the reader to the point where I had to reboot my phone.  That hasn't happened as much in 4.0.1.3, but there are still plenty of pauses and stalls just in turning pages.What is really bad is that I can't go to the table of contents any more.  On short story collections I purchased through Amazon, I used to be able to click on the menu button and go to the table of contents.  Now ToC is greyed out so I can't tap it.  The links to the ToC at the beginning of each story still work though.  I can't remember, but I think there are now more clicks to get to the ToC, even if it were working.Hopefully Google will point me to a previous version, because this has made my purchases useless.","overall":1.0,"summary":"4.1 still broken","unixReviewTime":1366934400,"reviewTime":"04 26, 2013","_etag":"b2bbc66047dcd49cfd7f44ec8272d046f30b5a2d","_updated":{"$date":"2018-10-01T13:45:23.000Z"},"requirement_type":"functional requirement"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd7dfa02974cb6480e9"},"reviewerID":"A1910S3BU0U339","asin":"B004DLPXAO","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Easy to download.

Even the \u0026#34;buy back\u0026#34; stores don't give you much for them.  I did that once and decided it wasn't worth the payback I had spent initially even though my books were in mint condition.

I liked to \u0026#34;hold\u0026#34; a book. How wrong I was! I got a tablet. Then I got the Kindle for Android app. I will never be the same. I go absolutely nowhere without my tablet. I seldom use my tablet for anything other than the Kindle app. In the couple of years I've had it, I have about 3,000 books downloaded. Most are safely housed in the cloud, but a good many are downloaded to my device. My huge selection of books go everywhere with me - with no lugging heavy books. Maybe you like to carry a heavy or even light book that takes up room, but I prefer taking 20 or 30 books with me that take virtually no space - only the slim size of my tablet. When I finish a book, I have a huge selection to choose from to start another one. You would have to carry two handheld books if you're nearly at the end of one and need another. The Kindle app has made life so much easier! I always have many things to read, not to mention the book prices are phenomenal and so very affordable - especially the free ones, that have introduced me to many fantastic authors I might never have heard of or read, had it not been for the Kindle app. And it's free! It doesn't get better than that! I have the app, not only on my tablet, but my desktop and laptop and my book(s) will sync perfectly, regardless which device I'm using. I am 66 and wish I'd been able to grow up with a Kindle app -- I am so thankful I have one now, and will always have plenty of great books to read.

This makes kindle books thoroughly unusable for citation purposes, a feature strictly obligatory for anyone publishing seriously in a generic setting and much more so with scientific literature.Markings in one color only. This shortcoming deprives readers from coded markings, such as `useful`, `important`, `very important` etc.Mathematical formulas are usually included as tiny and unreadable images or pictures, which get readable only via some double tap putting them isolated and as full size image onto the Android's device display. This design decision, however, yanks formulas thoroughly out of context, making such kindle books very hard to read and degrading very seriously any reasonable reading experience. This is a particularly severe shortcoming, rendering kindle books in a scientific setting virtually unusable and unreadable. This severe shortcoming, by the way, is *not* reflected via a book preview browsing this web site, say, yet will be experienced via a Kindle App on an Android device.Looking more into this nagging detail reveals that Amazon picked a severe software design boner here. While it appears usual with other e-book formats as well to include formulas and similar stuff as images or pictures, other e-readers, such as e.g. the standard Google ebook reader, do nicely zoom these pictures when zooming in on a page, whereas the Amazon Kindle app has those pictures stay put with respect to their size when zooming in on a page - fonts and text are enlarged, yet formulas or pictures remain tiny and unreadable. The only workaround here is some double tap on a formula picture, making it displayed in full size as a single image on the Android's device display. Who on earth specified this software crap at Amazon? Other e-readers do much better here!No animated page turnings. While this is more of a purely aesthetical aspect, it may play some role in attracting younger readers such as kids towards electronic media.","overall":1.0,"summary":"Major shortcomings","unixReviewTime":1400371200,"reviewTime":"05 18, 2014","_etag":"123935ab6caa6e62b792a004e08b67b2e1ef50aa","_updated":{"$date":"2018-10-18T00:36:35.000Z"},"requirement_type":"functional requirement"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd7dfa02974cb648352"},"reviewerID":"ABNM5EGVII0NY","asin":"B004DLPXAO","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"This app is not as easily navigated as I would have expected it to be.

With Kindle for Android, that's impossible.  First, it takes a minimum of 30 seconds for the program to start.  Sometimes, it won't start and instead will freeze the phone.  When this happens, I take the battery out and start over.  Thanks, Amazon!  Then, Kindle for Android page turns happen sporadically.  Sometimes, if you get impatient or think the first swipe didn't take, you swipe again.  Then, you get two pages.  Other times, it freezes and you get a window asking if you'd like to Wait or Force Close.Kindle for Android does not play well with the phone.  If you get a call while using Kindle for Android, often you are unable to swipe the switch to pick up the call.  Then you get the call log screen.  When you exit that, if you're unlucky, Kindle for Android will freeze.When I first started using the Kindle for Android app, I liked it better than FBReader, nook, and the Overdrive reader.  It was superior to all of them.  I now have many books in my Amazon archive, but the latest Kindle for Android app has made them all but unreadable.  If you're thinking of getting this app, I strongly suggest you instead find a way to circumvent the DRM on your Amazon-crippled ebook products and read them with something that works.","overall":1.0,"summary":"$%^%\u0026* Kindle App Has Crashed AGAIN!","unixReviewTime":1341532800,"reviewTime":"07 6, 2012","_etag":"f9aeac7269835aa3d021e8d568ffa3af8843bf73","_updated":{"$date":"2018-10-18T00:37:42.000Z"},"requirement_type":"functional requirement"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd7dfa02974cb6483a2"},"reviewerID":"A122ZYY9JG2U2C","asin":"B004DLPXAO","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Will never be without some form of Kindle.

I love this app - have it on 2 phones and my desktop. Why do I love it - let me count the ways: its always there. Once downloaded, you can read anywhere. It syncs among all the devices, so wherever you are on one device, just open the next device and you are all set. you can adjust brightness or look up a word you don't understand, without stopping reading. You can also look up other things using your phone's capabilities - so while reading one book, looked up a reference to see if the table described was real or invented. Take it to the doctor's office, airport, etc - no heavy book to hold and you can bring along as many books as you would like. It is easy and intuitive.Issues are - some physical books have photo pages that are not necessarily in the kindle edition; photos, maps, drawings, don't seem to enlarge the way text does; it keeps track of last page read but sometimes has a problem with a book with endnotes. When you press on the endnote number, it takes you directly to the note. But, when trying to return - may take you back or may not. Then you have to figure out where you were to get back to reading. It also then marks this endnote page as the last page read. To fix that you need to go online to remove the last page read designation, go to where you want to be in the book and when you exit, that will be the last page. However, you need to do this with each device you have.Recent time consuming glitch - invalid book message that tells you to delete and then get from all items. Answer on website forum doesn't work; went through 2 tech advisers and then a 3rd on tier 2 support, then was able to add my suggestions to figure out what to do. Got it fixed, but that meant re-downloading each book to each device that had that problem. Not a huge deal, but annoying.  I still think is the best app for reading.

I'm beginning to think the Kindle development team doesn't read. 2) There are still no text or background color choices other than black, white and sepia. Again, the reason for this remains unfathomable. The first color pda, the Palm IIIc, was introduced in 2000 and its eReader app allowed users to choose their own foreground and background colors. In an industry where a year is like a decade or more, the Android Kindle app remains in the ereader stone age, still behind the first color ereader! This would not be a big deal except for the fact that a lot of people read in bed before they go to sleep and it is well known that white light (particularly the blue component) seriously inhibits sleep. (See; e.g., [...]) This is not rocket science guys. Get a clue. Red, yellow or amber text on a black background would be a major improvement for those of us who like to read before sleeping and then get to sleep easily!Revised 07/02/2013: Latest version as of 7/2/2013 crashes on Droid X Android ver. 2.3.3. This happened a couple of years ago and it took months for it to be fixed. Advice is don't upgrade until you can verify it will work.Other than this, product has been improving steadily. Two other remaining deficiencies: 1) no ability to use a dictionary of your choice, even though Amazon sells other dictionaries; the one included for free, while okay, is simply inadequate: missing many common words. 2)There is really no excuse for the program to be limited to a black and white screen. This was okay when screens were only B\u0026W;, but how archaic is that today? Many who read at night prefer color combinations that are easier on their eyes and do not affect their night vision.Revised 11/16/2011: The Android version of the Kindle app has gradually gotten better and better (current ver 3.2.0.35):Usability features still lacking: 1) no commercial dictionary or thesaurus capability. 2) Highlight beyond a couple of words on a small screen unusable.1) Search now works much faster on a 1 ghz Droid X.2) There is now a real dictionary that is loaded locally. Its lookups are very quick. A vast improvement. The Kindle app, however, still needs the ability to add 3rd party dictionaries. Other eReaders have no issues with using better dictionaries; and, indeed, Amazon sells Kindle versions of some of these other dictionaries; e.g., Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary.3) The Kindle automatic cloud backup of user notes and bookmarks is a nice feature which is getting more reliable but it is still buggy. On occasion my bookmarks and notes for book I am currently reading have been wiped out. Not fatal, but irritating.4) The Kindle Options choices of type font, type size, and foreground/background colors are too limited. The provided reading fonts and sizes are not a problem but a question of preference. On the other hand, foreground/background colors should be easy to enlarge: in some reading environments white, black or sepia just don't work.","overall":3.0,"summary":"2014 Version 4.4.0.48: Still improving; Still glaring deficiencies","unixReviewTime":1303171200,"reviewTime":"04 19, 2011","_etag":"860f609d98beb19524ec3e5c543ad52dd1d826c3","_updated":{"$date":"2018-10-26T13:53:27.000Z"},"requirement_type":"non-functional requirement"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a5c1fd8dfa02974cb648442"},"reviewerID":"A2G8NL9K9KGRLR","asin":"B004DLPXAO","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"Joeveland\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Kindle for android is a pale shadow of the feature rich version for iPhone or iPod touch.
